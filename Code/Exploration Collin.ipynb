       "\" Abstract Background  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with a number of genetic and proteomic alterations. c-CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and adaptor molecule important in normal homeostasis and cancer. We determined the genetic variations of c-CBL, relationship to receptor tyrosine kinases (EGFR and MET), and functionality in NSCLC.  Methods and Findings  Using archival formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) extracted genomic DNA, we show that c-CBL mutations occur in somatic fashion for lung cancers. c-CBL mutations were not mutually exclusive of MET or EGFR mutations; however they were independent of p53 and KRAS mutations. In normal/tumor pairwise analysis, there was significant loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the c-CBL locus (22%, n\\u200a=\\u200a8/37) and none of these samples revealed any mutation in the remaining copy of c-CBL. The c-CBL LOH also positively correlated with EGFR and MET mutations observed in the same samples. Using select c-CBL somatic mutations such as S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* (obtained from Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American samples, respectively) transfected in NSCLC cell lines, there was increased cell viability and cell motility.  Conclusions  Taking the overall mutation rate of c-CBL to be a combination as somatic missense mutation and LOH, it is clear that c-CBL is highly mutated in lung cancers and may play an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and metastasis.  Go to: Introduction In the US alone, each year approximately 219,400 people are diagnosed with lung cancers, out of which more than 145,000 of them succumb to the disease [1]. This number is roughly equivalent to the combined mortality rates of cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney and melanoma [1]. In addition the prognosis is usually poor and the five-year survival rate is less than 15%. There are also significant ethnic differences for lung cancer, and the outcome is worse for blacks compared to whites. Gender differences are also striking with women having significantly better prognosis as compared to men. There are a number of genetic alterations that can occur in lung cancer. As an example, in NSCLC, mutations in KRAS, p53, EGFR and MET have been identified. Many of these pathways, especially Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are controlled by c-CBL.  CBL (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma) is a mammalian gene located on human chromosome 11q23.3 [2] and is involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination [3]. CBL proteins belong to the RING finger class of ubiquitin ligases (E3) and there are three homologues c-CBL, CBL-b, CBL-3 [4]. The c-CBL and CBL-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels in hematopoietic tissues [5]. c-CBL consists of four regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: the N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain, the linker region, the catalytic RING finger domain, the proline-rich region and the c-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain that also overlaps with a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain [3]. Both TKB and RING finger domains are essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination of RTKs [6], [7], [8], [9]. The RING finger domain is required for the recruitment of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. The TKB domain includes four-helix bundle (4H), a calcium-biding EF hand, and a modified SH2 domain, which binds to phosphotyrosine residues [3], [10], [11], [12]. In addition, the proline-rich region of c-CBL can associate with the SH3 domain of Grb2, which can indirectly recruit c-CBL to RTKs via the GRB2 adaptor protein [7], [13], [14].  c-CBL also binds to EGFR and acts as the E3 that targets EGFR for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, CBL desensitizes EGF signaling and opposes cellular proliferation induced by EGF [15]. EGF activation also appears to activate the tyrosine kinase SRC, which phosphorylates c-CBL and in turn activates the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR [16], [17], [18]. A recent study shows that defective endocytosis of EGFR is characterized by a deletion mutant and the point mutation L858R, whereby its association with c-CBL and subsequent ubiquitination are impaired [19]. Recently, the first human c-CBL mutations were reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [20]. The mutation R420Q inhibits FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20].  Not only can E3 activity be important in oncogenesis, c-CBL has a dual but separate function as a signal transduction molecule. We have previously shown that c-CBL is important in binding CRKL and BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells. Also, it can bind and modulate functions of cytoskeleton by binding to proteins like talin and paxillin. The TKB domain is important in binding to a number of molecules, and they then function in signal transduction.  Given the critical role of CBL in normal homeostasis and cancer, we hypothesized that it might be mutated in lung cancers. In this study, we report novel c-CBL somatic mutations S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* in Caucasian, Taiwanese and African-American lung cancer patients, respectively. Expressing these mutations in NSCLC cell lines lead to increased proliferation and cell motility. We show that c-CBL mutations occur with or without MET or EGFR mutations but are mutually exclusive of a LOH at the c-CBL locus. Additionally, c-CBL LOH is associated with either MET or EGFR mutations. We thus hypothesize that c-CBL mutations might contribute to the oncogenic potential of MET and EGFR in lung cancer.  Go to: Methods Ethics Statement  Written consent on all research on human subjects has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board, University of Chicago and covers all research performed in the laboratory. The following is their contact information: Institutional Review Board, The University of Chicago, McGiffert Hall, 5751 S. Woodlawn Ave., 2nd floor, Chicago, IL 60637. Written informed consents were received from all patients whose tissue samples were used for this study.  Tissue Samples  Lung cancer tissue and paired adjacent normal lung tissues were obtained from 50 Caucasian, 29 African-Americans and 40 Taiwanese NSCLC patients who were recruited at the University of Chicago Hospital (Chicago, USA) (Caucasian and African-American patients) and Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Taiwan (Taiwanese patients) after obtaining appropriate Institutional Review Board permission and informed consent from the patients. Out of 119 samples, 77 were men, 38 were women and 4 were unknown with age at diagnosis ranging from 47 to 90 years. In terms of tumor types, 53 were adenocarcinoma, 32 were squamous cell carcinoma and 34 were large cell carcinoma. 49 were stage I, 14 were stage II, 34 were stage III, and 13 were stage IV (Table S1).  Cell Culture  Human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells A549 and H358 were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640, respectively. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.  c-CBL Gene Mutational Analysis  Exons 2 to 16 of c-CBL gene were individually amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers are listed in Table S2. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 95°C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 2 minutes; and one cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were treated with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced by Big-Dye Terminator Chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing was performed on the forward coding strand with confirmation of c-CBL alterations performed by sequencing the reverse strand as well. Chromatograms were analyzed for mutations using Mutation Surveyor v2.61 (Softgenetics, State College, PA).  Plasmid Constructs and Site-Directed Mutagenesis  The wild-type c-CBL cDNA insert was subcloned into the pAlterMax expression vector using XhoI and SalI restriction enzyme sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Using this parental plasmid pAlterMax-c-CBL, the TKB domain double mutation (S80N/H94Y), the point mutation (Q249E), and the C-terminal point mutation W802* of c-CBL were created using the following primers: 5′-GCTGGCGCTAAAGAATAACCCACCTTATATCTTAGAC-3′ and 5′-CTACCAGATACCTACCAGTATCTCCGTACTATCTTGTC-3′ for the double mutation S80N/H94Y; 5′-CTTTACCCGACTCTTTGAGCCCTGGTCCTCTTTGC-3′ for Q249E, and 5′-CAGCTCCTCCTTTGGCTGATTGTCTCTGGATGGTGATC-3′ for W802* along with their complementary primers using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs were confirmed for the point mutations by standard DNA sequencing of both strands.  Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) Analysis  Five microsatellites on chromosome 11 (3 on 11q at or within 200 kb up or downstream of the c-CBL gene and 2 control markers on 11p) were selected for analysis (Table S3). Established microsatellite markers and respective primer sequences were selected from the GeneLoc database (http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/geneloc/index.shtml, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Primers were custom designed and each forward primer was fluorescently labeled at the 5′ end with FAM, PET, NED, or VIC (Applied Biosystems). Primer annealing temperatures and duplex scores were evaluated with NIST Primer Tools (http://yellow.nist.gov:8444/dnaAnalysis/primerToolsPage.do; National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD). Primers were verified by performing PCR with control DNA (isolated from TK6 cells) and resolving the products on agarose gels. Bands were visualized with an UV transilluminator. Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor samples and paired normal lung tissue. Primers were grouped into multiplex combinations shown in Table S4. Marker D11S929 served as an internal control to check for consistency in PCRs and of peaks from capillary electrophoresis. Multiplex PCRs were carried out in a volume of 10 µL that contained 1 µL genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 0.5 µM of each primer (1.0 µM total for each primer pair), 400 µM dNTPs, 1X PCR buffer containing MgCl2, and 0.2 U Taq DNA polymerase. PCR was performed on the ABI GeneAmp 9700 PCR System under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 1 min at 72°C; and 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were analyzed with Peak Scanner 1.0 and GeneMapper 3.7 software (Applied Biosystems) for allelic alterations. The area of the peaks produced by the DNA PCR products was quantified for each allele. The ratio of the allelic areas was calculated for each tumor and paired normal DNA sample. When the qLOH (allelic ratio for the tumor peaks divided by the allelic ratio of paired normal sample) was ≤0.5 or ≥2.0 for c-CBL and at least one other 11q marker in at least two separate experiments, the sample was considered as having an allelic imbalance and interpreted as LOH. Samples were evaluated in at least two separate experiments and samples showing prospective LOH at c-CBL repeated a third time which included a new control marker at the BAX locus (data not shown) on chromosome 19 to verify integrity of sample DNA.  Transfection of c-Cbl Constructs  The A549 cell line was transfected using the Fugene HD (Roche, Nutley, NJ) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eight µg of plasmid DNA, containing either no insert (empty vector), wild-type c-CBL, S80N/H94Y c-CBL, Q249E c-CBL or W802* CBL was used for transfection in a 6-well culture plate. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and analyzed for expression.  c-CBL Knockdown  c-CBL knockdown was performed using lentiviral transduction using MISSION lentiviral transduction particles (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1×105 H358 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and infected the following day with c-CBL lentiviral shRNA constructs. To generate stable c-CBL knockdown cell lines, cells were selected for 2 days with 1 µg/ml puromycin. c-CBL levels were determined using whole cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA).  Cell Viability Assay  Cells were transfected as described above in the transfection assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, viability of cells was assessed using Trypan Blue exclusion.  Wound Healing Assay  A549 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 48 h until 100% confluent. The medium was then changed and the cells were transfected as described in the transfection assay. Twelve hours after transfection, a straight scratch was made across the cell layer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were then gently washed with 1× PBS to remove cellular debris and the media was replaced. Photographs were taken of the wound region every 12 h until 48 h.  Western Blot Analysis  Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were collected and washed twice in 1X PBS, then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl with pH 7.4, 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 10% NP-40, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL leupeptin, and 10 µg/mL aprotinin) for 5 minutes. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C, and protein content of the supernatant was measured. Total cell lysates (50 µg/well) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and the gels transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (PBST) (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Membranes then were washed three times with PBST and probed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were again washed three times in PBST and bands were visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (BioRad, Valencia, CA) on a Chemidoc Gel documentation system (BioRad, Valencia, CA). Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies and used at the following dilutions (c-CBL, 1∶5000; c-MET, 1∶5000; EGFR, 1∶5000; ubiquitin, 1∶1000; HA, 1∶5000 and β-actin, 1∶10,000).  Flow Cytometry  Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Approximately 2×106 cells were grown in media containing 10% FBS. Cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment, washed with 1X PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 2 h. Cells were washed again with cold PBS and stained with a solution containing 25 µg/mL propidium iodide, 200 µg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes in the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed using a Guava PCA-96 flow cytometer (Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, MA).  Ubiquitin Ligase Activity  293T cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) were transfected with 0.2 µg EGFR-pcDNA3 and 2 µg HA-tagged c-CBL constructs as indicated using calcium phosphate according to manufacturer's protocol (Profection, Promega, Madison, WI). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were starved overnight in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, and then treated with or without EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were collected and washed two times in ice-cold PBS containing 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X100, 10% Glycerol, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors). Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. EGFR immunoprecipitations were performed on 200 µg of cleared lysate using 250 ng of rabbit-anti-EGFR and Protein A/G Plus Sepharose overnight at 4°C. Precipitations were washed 5 times in lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli buffer. Elutions were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin and EGFR. Twenty micrograms of cleared lysate were immunoblotted for each of the c-CBL constructs using anti-HA.  Statistical Analysis  Mutation rates between different groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, group comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak's adjustment for multiple comparisons. Experiments involving repeated measurements over time were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA with the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the degrees of freedom. Analyses were conducted using STATA (v10.1) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).  Go to: Results c-CBL Gene Mutations in Lung Cancer  To investigate the role of c-CBL in lung cancer, we analyzed its genomic DNA in tumor and paired normal samples drawn from multiple ethnicities. The lung tumor samples represented Caucasians (n\\u200a=\\u200a50), African-Americans (n\\u200a=\\u200a29), and Taiwanese (n\\u200a=\\u200a40) lung cancer patients. We designed 12 pairs of primers to sequence the coding region of c-CBL gene that spans exons 2 to 16 (Table S2). We identified 8 unique somatic mutations in c-CBL exons among 8 different patients. A variation L620F, a known SNP (rs2227988) in exon 11 was also detected. Importantly, the eight novel non-synonymous mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of c-CBL genomic DNA obtained from lung tumor samples (Table 1). Moreover, none of the 8 mutations were detected in the corresponding normal tissue, indicating that these were somatic mutations. Four synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were also identified but were not used further in this study.  Table 1 Table 1 c-CBL mutation analysis in 119 lung cancer patient tumor tissues. Three of the 8 novel non-synonymous mutations were located in the TKB (tyrosine kinase binding) domain (S80N, H94Y, and Q249E), one in the RING finger domain (V391I), one in the proline-rich region (72515_72517 del ATG), and three in the C-terminal region (W802*, R830K, and A848T) of the c-CBL protein (Figure 1A and Figure S1). In Figure 1B, we show model chromatograms of representative samples.  Figure 1 Figure 1 c-CBL mutations and LOH in non-small cell lung cancer. 11q LOH of c-CBL Gene  Paired lung tumor and normal lung tissue samples from Taiwanese patients (n\\u200a=\\u200a37) were investigated for LOH. Eight (21.6%) showed LOH at the c-CBL locus on chromosome 11 while 29 samples (78.4%) revealed normal allelic contribution at the microsatellite markers (Figures 1C and D).  c-CBL Mutations in Different Ethnic Groups  The c-CBL double mutant S80N/H94Y was found in the same patient and the overall mutation rate for c-CBL in lung tumors was 6.7% (8/119). The frequency of c-CBL mutation was highest in large cell carcinoma (14.7%; 5 of 34 patients) followed by squamous carcinoma (6.3%; 2 of 32 patients) and the least was observed in adenocarcinoma (AD) (1.8%; 1 of 53 patients), although these rates were not statistically significant (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.292). Mutation rates were 6.0% among Caucasians (0 of 20 in AD; 0 of 10 in SQ; and 3 of 20 in LC), 13.8% in African-Americans (1 of 10 in AD; 1 of 10 in SQ; and 2 of 9 in LC), and 2.5% (0 of 23 in AD; 1 of 12 in SQ; and 0 of 5 in LC) in the Taiwanese population. Additionally two Taiwanese patients with lung cancer (one squamous and one adenocarcinoma) had the known SNP L620F. Ethnic differences were not statistically significant, however the power to detect differences was low.  Mutations in MET and EGFR Can Be Co-Associated with c-CBL Alterations  Since East Asians with lung cancer have a higher frequency of EGFR and MET mutations in lung tumors [21], [22], we also determined mutations in EGFR and MET in the same Taiwanese cohort samples and compared the results with the observed c-CBL alterations (LOH and/or mutations). In the 37 samples tested, we did not find any overlap between c-CBL mutations and c-CBL LOH (Figure 2). Of the three c-CBL mutants (including the known L620F SNP, rs2227988), one of the samples had a MET mutation (N375S) and the other had an EGFR mutation (L858R). Among the 8 samples that had a LOH at the c-CBL locus 5 had an additional mutation in MET (N375S) and 2 had an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Twenty-six samples had neither c-CBL mutation nor c-CBL LOH (3 patients had a c-CBL mutation but no c-CBL LOH). Among these 26 samples 9 had a MET mutation (8 N375S, 1 L211W), 13 had an EGFR mutation (7 exon 9 deletion, 6 L858R) and 4 had no other MET or EGFR mutation. Thus the rate of MET or EGFR mutations among patients with LOH at the c-CBL locus (7 of 8) was similar to that seen in patients without c-CBL mutation or LOH (22 of 26 patients) (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.99). These 4 patients with no identifiable mutation in c-CBL, MET or EGFR represented 10.8% of the 37 patients analyzed in the Taiwanese patient cohort. Conversely, 89.2% Taiwanese lung cancer patients have an identifiable mutation in either c-CBL, MET or EGFR or a combination of the three genes (Figure 2). Additionally, we determined p53 and KRAS mutations in these Taiwanese cohorts. Two p53 and 1 KRAS mutation were detected. The single KRAS mutation overlapped with one p53 mutation. This patient also had the EGFR exon 19 deletion but had no c-CBL mutation. The other p53 mutation sample had a c-CBL LOH with concurrent MET N375S mutation. Thus, in the Taiwanese samples analyzed, p53/KRAS mutations and c-CBL mutations were mutually exclusive (data not shown).  Figure 2 Figure 2 c-CBL mutations and relationship to MET and EGFR mutations in lung cancer. Cellular Functions of c-CBL Alterations in the Context of Lung Tumorigenesis  A. E3 activity is intact in the mutant c-CBL proteins To investigate whether the different c-CBL mutations affect the E3 activity, EGFR was chosen as a model substrate for c-CBL E3 function. All of the c-CBL mutants tested enhanced ubiquitination of the activated EGFR similar to the wild-type c-CBL protein. This result demonstrates that the catalytic activity of the c-CBL mutants is not impaired when EGFR was the substrate. (Figure 3A).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Ubiquitination, viability, expression and cell cycle analysis of various c-CBL mutants. B. Effect on lung cancer cell viability The effect of a representative c-CBL mutant from each of the three ethnic backgrounds on lung cancer cell viability in cell lines was determined. S80N/H94Y double mutation, Q249E, and W802* were identified in lung tumor samples obtained from a Caucasian, a Taiwanese and an African-American, respectively. As described in methods, the c-CBL wild-type (WT) and the above three mutants were expressed after cloning them into pAlterMax vector in A549 cells. These cells express relatively low basal levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was comparable between different groups and the number of cells transfected with c-CBL wild-type construct was about 70% compared to control cells that were transfected with the empty vector. Cells transfected with S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* c-CBL mutant constructs resulted in increased number of viable cells that was 132.3%, 120.8% and 147.9% higher respectively, relative to the empty vector control transfected cells and significantly different from the wild-type construct (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.022, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.049, and p\\u200a=\\u200a0.008, respectively) (Figure 3B). Relative levels of c-CBL protein in whole cell lysates prepared from samples obtained from a parallel experiment was determined. The c-CBL protein levels in samples representing untransfected and empty vector transfected cells were comparable and those representing the c-CBL WT and the three c-CBL mutants were comparable (Figure 3C).  C. Effect on cell cycle To investigate if the increases in cell viability in different c-CBL mutants are due to increased cellular proliferation, a cell cycle analysis was performed. A549 cells were transfected with the c-CBL WT or the three different mutants: S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*. The empty vector transfectant was used as a control. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell cycle analysis was performed as described in materials and methods. There was no significant change in the subG1, G1 or the S phase of the cell cycle among the different mutants compared to the WT construct (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.64, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.40, and p\\u200a=\\u200a0.28, respectively). The G2/M phase of the cell cycle showed an increase in cell numbers for the three mutants, S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802*, when compared to the WT but again the difference was not statistically significant (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.25) (Figure 3D).  D. Effect on cell motility To investigate the effect of the expression of the above three c-CBL mutants on cell migration, we carried out wound healing assay as described in materials and methods. The closing of the scratch or the wound was monitored at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. (Figure 4A). In all the samples, that represented cells transfected with mutants, the wound gap was much smaller than that seen in the sample that represented cells transfected with c-CBL WT (p<0.001). We also determined the rate of wound closure for all the five groups. At 48 h, wild-type c-CBL transfectants showed 61.1% open wound while the S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* mutants showed 18.7%, 23.9% and 34.3% open wound respectively (p<0.001) (Figure 4B).  Figure 4 Figure 4 c-CBL mutations affect wound healing in A549 cells. E. c-CBL knockdown increases cell viability It is hypothesized that the LOH seen in our samples could lead to decreased expression of c-CBL. Thus we tested the effect of c-CBL knockdown in lung cancer cells. Compared to A549, H358 lung cancer cells express relatively high levels of endogenous c-CBL (data not shown). c-CBL expression was knocked down using lentiviral construct that expressed c-CBL specific shRNA and compared the results with those that were transduced with scrambled shRNA and the results are shown in Figure 5. We identified several clones that revealed varying degrees of c-CBL knockdown showing different sets of c-CBL lentiviral shRNA knockdown efficiency (Figure 5A). Of all the clones tested, Clone 27 was chosen for further experiments. Equal amount of cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and the cell proliferation was measured at various times and the results are depicted in Figure 5B. As expected, number of cells increased in a time dependent fashion from 100 to 190% relative to scrambled shRNA as control in a span of 48 h (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0002) (Figure 5B). The cell cycle phases in H358 cells that were knocked down with c-CBL shRNA were looked at and compared with the scrambled shRNA. There were no discernable differences between these two constructs in the different phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Knockdown of c-CBL using an shRNA increases cell proliferation. Go to: Discussion Our results demonstrate that c-CBL is somatically mutated (or has LOH) in lung cancers, and can significantly contribute to enhanced cell viability and motility. There was also a high prevalence of LOH with respect to c-CBL in lung tumors that harbored MET or EGFR mutation.  In the present study, we have demonstrated the occurrence of c-CBL mutations in lung cancer patients, especially with different ancestral variations. Mutations in c-CBL have been recently reported in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid malignancies. In the AML study, the mutation R420Q located in the junction of the RING finger and the linker region inhibited FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internalization and ubiquitination [20], thus contributing to the gain-in-function for the RTK. In addition, mutations such as H398Y, C384R, and L380P mapped to the RING finger domain and the linker region of c-CBL that is required for its E3 activity [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Additionally, homozygous mutations in the RING finger domain of the c-CBL gene were described as a result of acquired Uniparental Disomy (UPD) [26]. It is important to note that our results indicate LOH at 11q23 locus and these are mutually exclusive from missense mutations of c-CBL. The somatic mutations were all heterozygous. The mutations in AML led to abrogation of the E3 activity leading to prolonged RTK activation. In addition mutants located on the linker region surrounding the RING finger domain exhibited enhanced AKT signaling in response to cytokine stimulation [26]. In addition, it was shown in NH3T3 cells, that neither mutations in the RING finger nor the linker region causes transformation, however while certain mutations perturbs the ubiquitination, others affect receptor recycling and prolong kinase activity [28].  We report here c-CBL mutations that mapped not only to the RING finger domain, but also to the TKB domain, proline-rich domain and the C-terminal region, but none mapped to the linker region as reported in the AML studies described above [23], [24], [25], [26], [29]. In addition, 8 mutants that we detected were found in different ethnic backgrounds. For example, S80N/H94Y, Q249E, W802* were detected in Caucasians, Taiwanese and African-Americans, respectively. The results point out not only the difference between lung cancer and other cancers, but also genetic polymorphism among different races in the same cancer. Interestingly, there is a large disparity between African-American and other ethnic populations with lung cancer [30]. We have previously shown that there was a low frequency of EGFR and MET mutation in African-Americans as compared with Taiwanese and Caucasians [31]. In this study, the number of African-American samples analyzed was relatively fewer and we found 3 mutations that are unique to this ethnicity. It would now behoove us to further study the genetic alterations that can occur and determine the targeted therapeutics for African-Americans. Our results provide evidence of the importance of c-CBL in tumorigenesis and potential signaling. Our prediction, based on the AML data, would be that the V391I RING finger domain mutation would affect the E3 activity. Also, it will be important to determine the binding partners for c-CBL in the TKB domain and proline rich domain mutations. It has previously been shown that the TKB domain can bind to growth factor receptors and it will be important to determine the cross-binding of these mutants to MET and or EGFR. It would also be important in the future to look at fluorescence in situ hybridization/copy number changes in c-CBL in lung cancer.  c-CBL plays an important role in down regulating RTK-mediated signaling through K63 poly-ubiquitination and subsequent downregulation of RTKs followed by lysosomal degredation [3]. Mono-ubiquitination or ubiquitinated with K63-linked chains of substrates by c-CBL may lead to enhancement of biological and biochemical functions (reviewed in Hermann et al, 2007 [32]). The mutations that we analyzed in our studies all point out to the fact that the E3 activity of c-CBL on EGFR is intact; the EGFR levels in the various mutants remain same (Figure S2). Multiple kinases, both RTKs and non-RTKs could be acted upon by c-CBL, including ERBs, PDGFR, FMS, MET, c-Kit, VEGFR, FLT-1, RON, FGFR, IR, as well as SYK, FYN, LCK, FGR, LYN and c-ABL [3]. In lung cancers the relevant substrates of c-CBL in terms of degradation or signal transduction are yet to be identified.  The observation that c-CBL somatic mutations, especially S80N/H94Y, Q249E and W802* showed increased cell viability and cell motility that is in agreement with the physiological role for D-cbl in the regulation of apoptosis and differentiation identified in Drosophila is very significant [33]. It has been previously shown that activating c-CBL mutation downregulates EGFR signaling and decreases cellular proliferation and migration in breast cancer cell lines [34]. Although the role of c-CBL in the negative regulation of RTKs is well substantiated, thereby suggesting that it is a natural tumor suppressor, studies in cancer cells have revealed both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities depending on the type of c-CBL mutation and the number of alleles at the c-CBL locus [24]. In agreement with the above, the three c-CBL mutants described here appear to have tumor growth and metastasis promoting properties. Although these mutants are outside of the RING finger or the linker region of c-CBL, their downstream effects are significant so as to cause increased proliferation and migration, but the substrate affected by these mutations are not known yet. This raises the possibility that some of the cellular functions of c-CBL are independent of its ubiquitin-ligase activity, an area that we are currently investigating. The oncogenic nature of RTKs, addiction of cancers to growth signals and given the clustering of c-CBL, EGFR and MET mutations, it is possible that the transforming effect of c-CBL mutations is most likely a combinatorial effect of the three. We also show that LOH for c-CBL was found in a significant number of samples that harbored MET or EGFR mutations. The fact that about 7% of lung tumor samples are likely to have c-CBL mutations and an additional 22% are likely to harbor c-CBL-related LOH, makes c-CBL a highly mutated molecule in lung cancer. Since LOH alone is not enough to cause a transforming event [35], [36], [37], associated mutation in the MET or EGFR locus or yet another RTK discussed above may play a role in carcinogenesis. We predict that this LOH in c-CBL results in haploinsufficiency that downplays RTK ubiquitination leading to hyperactivity of the RTKs. However, whether this is sufficient cause for tumorigenesis remains to be determined. Consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that c-cbl-/- mice have increased kinase activity in lymphocytes, but is not sufficient for tumor formation [35], [36], [37]. c-CBL LOH could also lead to increased expression of c-CBL from the other allele to compensate for a loss of an allele. Alternately, there could be some form of synergy working with reduced c-CBL levels and mutated receptors that exacerbate the phenotype of each alone.  Previous studies from our lab and others have shown that East Asians with lung cancers have relatively high frequencies of gain-of-function of mutations in RTKs such as EGFR and MET [31]. In a cohort of Japanese patients an activating MET mutation was identified in the splice region that deletes the juxtamembrane domain that is involved E3 activity of c-CBL [38]. This study also found that activation of MET is mutually exclusive of EGFR, KRAS and HER2 gene mutations [38]. We failed to detect such mutations in significant numbers in lung tumor samples obtained from African-Americans (n\\u200a=\\u200a29) and Caucasian (n\\u200a=\\u200a50) patients. One MET mutation was identified in each of the groups whereas 1 and 3 EGFR mutations were identified in the African-American and Caucasian cohorts respectively. EGFR mutations have earlier been identified as one of the key mutations affecting lung adenocarcinoma patients in a comprehensive study of 188 patients [39]. Our study encompasses different histologies of NSCLC. However, the published series did not find any mutations in c-CBL or MET unlike our study that encompassed different subtypes of NSCLC. It is important to note, we have recently shown that MET mutations in lung cancer are in majority germline [31]. We have reported earlier c-CBL mutations in a small cohort of Taiwanese lung cancer samples [40]. In our efforts to understand the ethnic differences in the lung oncogenome, we also looked at PAX transcription factors such as PAX5 and PAX8 that are highly expressed in lung cancers; however there was no preferential expression or mutations of the above genes in lung tumor samples of African-Americans. In this study, we show relatively high frequency of c-CBL mutations in lung cancers, especially in the large cell type among Caucasians and particularly among African-Americans. We therefore propose c-CBL as an efficacious target for lung cancers in African-Americans that needs to be further substantiated. This is all the more important because the prognosis for African-Americans with lung cancer, especially for men is much poorer compared to their Caucasian counterparts [41].  In conclusion, the results presented in this study demonstrate that c-CBL is frequently mutated or even lost in lung cancers. Our results support a role for c-CBL mutants that are independent of its ubiquitination activity. Given the relatively high mutation rates in c-CBL as well as RTKs such as MET and EGFR, it is likely that their combined effect could be synergistic in promoting tumorigenesis.\""

       "\"Sequencing studies have identified many recurrent coding mutations in human cancer genes; however, highly recurrent mutations involving regulatory regions have rarely been observed. Here we describe two independent mutations within the TERT core promoter that, when taken together, were observed in 71% (50 of 70) of melanomas and generate de novo consensus ETS binding motifs. Reporter assays showed that these mutations increase transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter by 2–4-fold. Examination of cancer cell lines derived from diverse tumor types revealed the same mutations in 16% (24 of 150) of cases, with preliminary evidence of elevated frequency in bladder and hepatocellular cancer cells. Thus, somatic mutations in regulatory regions of the genome may represent an important tumorigenic mechanism.  Systematic characterization of human cancer genomes has led to the discovery of a wide range of mutated genes that contribute to tumor development and progression. Most of the somatic mutations in tumors reside within the protein-coding regions of genes or at splice junctions. To determine whether tumor genomes harbor recurrent mutations outside of protein-coding regions, we systematically queried noncoding somatic mutations using published whole-genome sequencing data.  Analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from malignant melanomas (1, 2) revealed two somatic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter mutations in 17 of 19 (89%) cases examined. The average sequence coverage at the TERT promoter locus was 30-fold in normal samples and 60-fold in tumor samples (fig. S1A). Each of these promoter mutations resulted in a cytidine-to-thymidine transition at a dipyrimidine motif indicative of ultraviolet (UV) light–induced damage (chr5, 1,295,228 C>T and 1,295,250 C>T; hereafter termed C228T and C250T, respectively), and both mutations localized within 100 base pairs (bp) of the TERT transcriptional start site (TSS) (mean allelic fraction, 0.32; range, 0.07 to 0.55) (table S1). We validated these mutations by means of polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing tumor/normal sample pairs from both the discovery set (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, B and C) and an extension set of 51 additional melanoma tumor/normal sample pairs. Within this extension set, 33 tumors (65%) harbored one of the mutations. Moreover, the mutations were mutually exclusive in both the discovery and extension sets (P = 5.4 × 10−7, Fisher’s one-sided exact test). Two tumors with a C228T transition also contained an adjacent C>T transition (at position chr5, 1,295,229), which is indicative of a dinucleotide CC>TT transition. Together, these TERT promoter mutations were observed in 50 of 70 (71%; 95% confidence interval: 59 to 82%, Clopper-Pearson method) melanomas examined (Fig. 1B and table S1).  Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Identification of TERT promoter mutations in melanoma and cancer cell lines Both C228T and C250T generated an identical 11-bp nucleotide stretch (5′-CCCCTTCCGGG-3′) containing a consensus binding site for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors (GGAA, reverse complement) within the TERT promoter region. Because ETS transcription factors may become activated through dysregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, we hypothesized that these promoter mutations might augment gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we used a reporter assay system in which the relevant portion of the mutant or wild-type TERT core promoter was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (2). Here, we tested both a core promoter fragment (−132 to +5 relative to the TSS) and the full core promoter (−200 to +73). In comparison to the wild-type TERT promoter, both mutations conferred approximately two- to fourfold increased transcriptional activity in five distinct cell line contexts (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Thus, each mutation was capable of augmenting transcriptional activity from the TERT promoter.  To investigate whether similar TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types, we examined sequencing data from this locus in 150 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (3). Overall, 24 CCLE lines (16%) contained either C228T or C250T (mean allelic fraction, 0.61; range, 0.17 to 1.00) (table S1). An increased frequency in melanoma was again noted (five of six lines tested), with additional evidence suggesting possible heightened prevalence (>25%; one-sided 95% confidence interval) in bladder (three of three lines) and hepatocellular cancer cell lines (four of six lines) (Fig. 1D).  Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that these promoter mutations may function as driver events that contribute to oncogenesis through TERT dysregulation and undergo positive selection, at least in human melanoma. First, the TERT promoter mutations showed a combined frequency that exceeded those of BRAF and NRAS mutations, which activate known melanoma driver oncogenes (4, 5). In an analysis restricted to somatic mutations present at an allelic fraction of 0.2 or greater [to reduce artifacts of mutation calling (1)], the four most recurrent melanoma nucleotide substitutions included BRAF [chr7, 140,453,136 A>T (V600E)], NRAS [chr1, 115,256,529 T>C (Q61R)], and the TERT core promoter mutations C228T and C250T. Second, although highly recurrent, C228T and C250T occurred in a wholly mutually exclusive fashion. This suggests the possibility that the mutations might be functionally redundant. Third, the absence of other recurrent somatic mutations in the 3 kb upstream of the TERT transcription start site in the queried melanomas (1) coupled with the absence of the described TERT promoter mutations in 24 lung adenocarcinomas with comparably high somatic mutation rates (6) reduces the possibility that these recurrent TERT promoter mutations are solely due to an increased background mutation rate at this locus. Although the role of telomerase in tumorigenesis is well established, details regarding its dysregulation in cancer cells remain incompletely understood, particularly in melanoma (7). The TERT promoter mutations identified here may link telomerase gene regulation and tumorigenic activation in this malignancy. The high prevalence of C228T and C250T suggests that these TERT promoter mutations may comprise early genetic events in the genesis of melanoma and other cancer types. Although TERT expression alone is not sufficient to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, genomic TERT activation may potentiate mechanisms by which melanocytes achieve immortalization in the setting of oncogenic mutations (8). These results therefore suggest that renewed efforts to develop clinically effective telomerase inhibitors may be warranted.  At the same time, promoter mutations likely represent only one potential mechanism of TERT reactivation in a subset of human cancers. Indeed, recurrent chromosomal copy gains spanning the TERT locus have been described previously for several cancers, including melanoma (9, 10).  Highly recurrent somatic mutations within a cancer gene promoter region have not previously been described. Similarly, the de novo mutational generation of transcription factor binding motifs in tumor genomes was heretofore unknown, although an ETS transcription factor binding motif was previously associated with a single-nucleotide polymorphism insertion at the MMP-1 locus (11). Together, these findings raise the possibility that recurrent somatic mutations involving regulatory regions, in addition to coding sequences, may represent important driver events in cancer.  TERT Promoter Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Melanoma Susanne Horn,1,2 Adina Figl,1,2 P. Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda,1 Christine Fischer,3 Antje Sucker,2 Andreas Gast,1,2 Stephanie Kadel,1,2 Iris Moll,2 Eduardo Nagore,4 Kari Hemminki,1,5 Dirk Schadendorf,2 *† Rajiv Kumar1 *† Cutaneous melanoma occurs in both familial and sporadic forms. We investigated a melanoma-prone family through linkage analysis and high-throughput sequencing and identified a disease-segregating germline mutation in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase. The mutation creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors and ternary complex factors (TCFs) near the transcription start and, in reporter gene assays, caused up to twofold increase in transcription. We then screened the TERT promoter in sporadic melanoma and observed recurrent ultraviolet signature somatic mutations in 125 of 168 (74%) of human cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, 45 of 53 corresponding metastatic tumor tissues (85%), and 25 of 77 (33%) primary melanomas. The majority of those mutations occurred at two positions in the TERT promoter and also generated binding motifs for Ets/TCF transcription factors. The identification of germline mutations that cosegregate with disease in cancerprone families often provides genetic and mechanistic insights into the more common, sporadically arising cancers. In a study of cutaneous melanoma, the most malignant skin cancer, we investigated a large pedigree with 14 related melanoma patients who were not carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A or CDK4, two known melanoma genes (Fig. 1). Multipoint linkage analysis showed a possible 2.2-Mb linkage region on chromosome 5p with maximal logarithm of the odds ratio for linkage scores of 2.35 at rs1379917 and 2.45 at rs1968011. Target-enriched high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the region was carried out on constitutional DNA from the four affected and four unaffected members of the family with an average coverage between 55- and 108-fold (table S1) (1). The HTS data revealed a single promoter variant, three intronic variants, and three nongene variants previously unknown and unique to the DNA sequences of the affected individuals (table S2). The disease segregating variants, seven in total, were validated by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the individuals sequenced by HTS and of DNA from additional unaffected members of the family. The new variants were also detected in an unaffected member (754, table S3), who was 36 years old and carried multiple nevi. DNA from affected individuals other than those sequenced by HTS was not available for testing. Of the seven unique variants identified, one variant (T>G), was located in the promoter at –57 base pairs (bp) from ATG translation start site of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) gene. The TERT gene encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains telomere length. The nucleotide change in the sequence CCTGAA>CCGGAA creates a new binding motif for Ets transcription factors, with a general recognition motif GGA(A/T). Beyond the general motif for Ets transcription factors, the familial mutation also generates a binding motif, CCGGAA, for the ternary complex factors (TCFs) Elk1 and Elk4 (2, 3). To exclude the possibility that the detected promoter mutation in TERT is a common germline variant, we screened germline DNA from 140 sporadic melanoma cases and 165 healthy controls, and none carried the variant. Screening of DNA from index cases from 34 Spanish melanoma families also did not show any mutations. No carriers were found in dbSNP and the 1000 Genomes databases (data available for 18 individuals were obtained from Ensembl). The familial mutation in the TERT promoter was in complete allelic linkage with a common polymorphism rs2853669 (G>A) at –246 bp upstream from the ATG start site (table S3). In previous work, this polymorphism was reported to disrupt an Ets binding site, and it was associated with low telomerase activity in patients with non– small cell lung cancer (4). In luciferase reporter gene assays, we found that the activity of constructs containing the mutation at –57 bp of the TERT promoter was increased 1.5-fold and 1.2- fold over the wild-type construct in Ma-Mel-86a and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, respectively. A construct with both the TERT mutation and the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism showed a 2.2-fold increase in promoter activity in Ma-Mel-86a and and 1.3-fold increase in HEK293 cells (mean from three measurements; details in supplementary text and fig. S1). The germline occurrence of the promoter mutation, creating an Ets/TCF motif, can result in modification of TERT expression in all tissues expressing Ets/TCF. Highest staining for the TCF Elk1 protein has been reported in female-specific tissues, such as ovary and placenta. The increased expression of TCF Elk1 protein in female-specific tissues may cause gender-related differences in 1 Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 2 Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, 45122 Essen, Germany. 3 Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. 4 Department of Dermatology, Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, Valencia, Spain. 5 Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two affected members of the family developed several different types of cancer (marked with # in Fig. 1). One affected individual presented with ovarian cancer at age 27 and melanoma at age 30. Another individual was diagnosed with melanoma at age 20; later she developed ovarian cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer, mammary carcinoma, and finally bronchial carcinoma, leading to her death at age 50. The mutation in the melanoma-prone family prompted us to screen melanoma cell lines derived from sporadic cases of metastatic melanoma. None of the cell lines carried the mutation detected in the family. However, we identified recurrent ultraviolet (UV)–signature mutations in the TERT core promoter in 74% (125 of 168) of the cell lines. The mutations were located within a 49-bp region starting from –100 bp upstream of the ATG start site (Table 1, Fig. 2, fig. S2, and table S4). There were two frequent mutations at –124 bp (G>A; C>T on opposite strand) and –146 bp (G>A); these mutations were mutually exclusive and occurred in 27 and 38% of cell lines, respectively. Two tandem GG>AA (CC>TT) mutations at positions –124/–125 bp and –138/–139 bp were observed at a frequency of 9%. The tandem mutation at positions –138/–139 bp could also be generated by a single-base mutation at –138 bp, because the base change at –139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism (rs35550267). The two most frequent single-base mutations as well as the two tandem mutations also result in the creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs. Mutations were confirmed in 45 of 53 (85%) available metastasized tumors corresponding to the cell lines. The somatic nature of the mutations was shown by the absence of mutations in corresponding DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells available from 23 patients. Somatic mutations in the TERT promoter were more frequent than the BRAF mutations (53%, 90 of 169), CDKN2A alterations (50%, 84 of 169), and NRAS mutations (23%, 38 of 169; fig. S3). The occurrence of concomitant mutations in the TERT promoter and BRAF was more frequent (47%) than by random chance (40%) with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 8.2]. Concomitant mutations in TERT, BRAF, and CDKN2Awere observed in 30% of cell lines compared with the expected frequency of such occurrence of 9% (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4 to 13.8). The high recurrence and specificity of the TERT promoter mutations, together with the preliminary evidence from reporter assays that they have a functional effect on transcription, suggest that these mutations are driver rather than passenger events. Extensive functional studies will be required to validate this hypothesis. The TERT promoter mutations were also detected in 25 out of 77 (33%) paraffin embedded primary melanoma tumors (Table 1 and table S5) at –124 bp (7/77; 9%) and –146 bp (5/77; 7%). Four primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –124/–125 bp, and eight primary tumors carried the GG>AA tandem mutations at –138/–139 bp. Reduced sensitivity to detect mutations in paraffin-embedded primary tumors because of contaminating normal cells cannot be ruled out. Primary tumors harbored five additional mutations in the TERT promoter, which were not present in metastases, and those did not generate Ets/TCF binding motifs. We also screened DNA extracted from 25 melanocytic nevi and only one carried a mutation at –101 bp, which did not create an Ets/TCF motif. For both primary tumors and melanocytic nevi, matched normal control DNA was not available for testing. The TERT coding region has been reported to be somatically mutated in 1% of cancers (14 cancer types, 1271 unique samples) (6). Mutations creating Ets/TCF binding motifs in the TERT promoter in melanoma have not been described in earlier sequencing projects. TCFs are a subfamily of Ets transcription factors; two members of this subfamily, Elk1 and Elk4, are downstream targets of BRAF and regulate the expression of many genes (7–11). Conceivably, TCF may represent a link between telomerase activity and the frequent BRAF activating mutations in melanoma (fig. S4) (12, 13). Lastly, whether TERT promoter mutations occur in other cancer types remains to be determined. We did not detect these mutations in a screen of 22 esophageal squamous cell c  Reactivation of telomerase has been implicated in human tumorigenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we report the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the TERT promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43%), bladder (59%), thyroid (follicular cell-derived, 10%) and skin (melanoma, 29%). In thyroid cancers, the presence of TERT promoter mutations (when occurring together with BRAF mutations) is significantly associated with higher TERT mRNA expression, and in glioblastoma we find a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases harbouring TERT promoter mutations. Both in thyroid cancers and glioblastoma, TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with older age of the patients. Our results show that TERT promoter mutations are relatively frequent in specific types of human cancers, where they lead to enhanced expression of telomerase.

Reactivation or re-expression of telomerase is referred to be a widespread feature in human cancers, although the genetic basis remains poorly understood in many cancer types. Somatic mutations in the coding region of TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) are infrequent in human tumours, but germline and somatic mutations in TERT promoter were recently found in a high percentage of human melanomas and human cancer cell lines1,2. Such mutations occurred in two hotspot positions, located  124 and  146 bp upstream from the ATG start site (  124 G4A and  146 G4A, C4T on opposite strand) and conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity1,2, by putatively generating a consensus binding site (GGAA) for ETS transcription factors within the TERT promoter region1,2. Our aim was to investigate whether the aforementioned TERT promoter mutations were present in cancer types other than melanoma, having for that matter screened 741 primary tumours from the thyroid, kidney, bladder, gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), adrenal medulla (phaeochromocytomas) and central nervous system (CNS). Besides skin melanoma, we have also included ocular melanoma (not studied in the previous reports), benign lesions of the thyroid and skin and 58 human cancer-derived cell lines. Our results highlight TERT promoter mutations as frequent events in specific types of human cancers. Results TERT mutations in tumours and cell lines. Overall, TERT promoter mutations were found in 142 (19%) human tumour samples (Table 1; Fig. 1a) and 14 (24%) human cell lines (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The  124-bp mutation was the most frequent, being present in 99 cases, whereas the  146- bp mutation was present in 43 cases. The  124 G4A and  146 G4A mutations were found in a mutually exclusive fashion. Two tandem GG4AA mutations at positions  124/  125 and  138/  139 bp were observed in one cell line each (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue nor in benign lesions (nevi, thyroiditis, goitres and adenomas). No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytomas and 36 GISTs. TERT mutations in melanoma. We have analysed both skin and ocular melanomas, a type of melanoma that was not previously studied1,2. TERT mutations were present in 16 out of 56 (29%) skin melanomas, but absent in the 25 ocular melanomas (Table 1). All the four skin melanoma-derived cell lines but none of the six ocular melanoma-derived cell lines harboured TERT mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of 16 (63%) skin melanomas with TERT mutation also harboured the BRAFV600E mutation, whereas the BRAF mutation was present in 9 out of 38 (24%) melanomas without TERT mutation (P ¼ 0.01, Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3). TERT mutations in CNS tumours. In CNS tumours, TERT promoter mutations were found in 43% (51/118) of all cases with an equal prevalence of both mutations (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4). The frequency of TERT mutations was different according to the tumour histology and grade (Fig. 1c): although pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1) and diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) showed a lower frequency of mutations (8% and 15%, respectively), the most aggressive form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; WHO grade 4), present the highest frequency of TERT mutations (62%). Oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 3) also harboured a high frequency of TERT mutations (45% and 54%, respectively). The presence of TERT mutations was significantly associated with a higher mean age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table S5) in CNS patients as a whole (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, twotailed) and also in GBM patients only (P ¼ 0.0247; Mann– Whitney test, two-tailed); in oligodendroglioma patients, we found the same trend, although not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.0709; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed). In addition, we observed that, in a subset of 14 GBM (8 TERT wild-type tumours and 6 TERT-mutated tumours), the tumours with TERT mutations showed a trend to increased immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression of telomerase, although this difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.4250; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) (Fig. 2). TERT mutations in thyroid cancer. We analysed a large series of follicular cell-derived thyroid samples including normal thyroid (n ¼ 27), benign (n ¼ 81) and malignant lesions (n ¼ 263) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S6). TERT mutations were only detected in malignant tumours (10%) (Fig. 1d), namely in Table 1 | Prevalence of TERT promoter recurrent mutations in human cancers.

Within the group of PTC, TERT mutations were detected to be associated to the so-called conventional PTC (cPTC) (11%).The majority of TERT-mutated thyroid cancers harboured the  124 G4A mutation (22 out of 27 cases) (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table S7). In thyroid cancer patients, TERT mutations were significantly associated with guarded prognosis features such as larger tumours (P ¼ 0.008; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed), older patients (Po0.0001; Mann–Whitney test, two-tailed) and male gender (P ¼ 0.0312; Fisher’s exact test, two-sided) (Supplementary Table S5).

In bladder cancer, TERT mutations were frequently detected (48/82; 59%) both in lowgrade tumours (14/21; 67%) and high-grade tumours (34/61; 56%) (Table 1 and Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table S9). The  124 G4A mutation was present in 30 cases, whereas the  146 G4A was found in 18 cases. No association was found between the presence of the mutation and the age of the patients. No mutations were detected in 26 kidney cancers, 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs (Supplementary Tables S10, S11 and S12, respectively). Discussion Recent findings have described that TERT promoter mutations arise as a novel mechanism of telomerase reactivation/expression in human cancers1,2. In this work, we report for the first time the presence of these mutations in different histotypes of thyroid cancer, and our results validate the findings reported by others in melanoma, bladder and gliomas1–3. Furthermore, we present for the first time evidence showing that TERT promoter mutations are significantly associated with increased TERT mRNA expression in thyroid cancers. We also found a trend for increased telomerase expression in cases of GBM harbouring TERT promoter mutations. In thyroid cancers, TERT mRNA was particularly high in cases harbouring both TERT and BRAF mutations. The location of these mutations in the TERT promoter, rather than the coding region of the gene, creating additional binding sites for transcription factors, represents also a novel mechanism of genetic activation in cancer. The frequency of TERT mutations we detected in skin melanomas is similar to that reported by Horn et al.1 in primary melanomas (33%), but lower than the frequency found by the same authors in metastatic melanomas (85%) and by Huang et al.2 in a series of 70 melanomas and short-term cultures1,2. In our series, we have analysed few metastatic melanomas that did not show a significantly higher percentage of TERT mutations. As our series is too small to allow a conclusion, it remains to be verified if there is an increased frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas, as suggested by previous reports1,2. We have confirmed, in skin melanomas, the significant association between TERT and BRAF mutations, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1, which we now also demonstrate in thyroid cancers. Interestingly, in benign nevi, which frequently harbour BRAF mutations, we did not detect TERT mutations. This finding, together with the high frequency of TERT mutations in metastatic melanomas1, suggests that, although BRAF mutations are thought to be an early event in melanoma genesis, TERT mutations may occur at a later stage. No TERT promoter mutations were found in ocular melanomas, which, at variance with skin melanomas, harbour GNAQ mutations instead of BRAF mutations4,5. Our results further support the assumption that ocular melanomas result from different etiopathogenic mechanism than skin melanomas5,6. Our data on CNS tumours indicate that TERT promoter mutations are frequent events in gliomas, particularly in GBM where the highest mutation frequency was found. It has been shown that TERT mutations conferred enhanced TERT promoter activity in vitro1,2; our findings fit with this assumption because we observed that GBM with TERT promoter mutations appear to display increased telomerase expression, despite the limited sensitivity of IHC and the low number of cases analysed. Our results are also in concordance with those of Lotsch et al.7 who reported that 60% of GBMs were positive for TERT mRNA and telomerase activity7. It will be interesting to assess whether the GBM positive for telomerase activity described by Lotsch et al.7 also harbour TERT promoter mutations. Our findings also indicate that TERT mutations are associated with older patients, in accordance with a recent report3. The high frequency of TERT mutations in CNS tumours, particularly in intermediate and high-grade tumours, opens a window for new approaches in the therapy of CNS tumours. In thyroid cancer, TERT mutations were only found in follicular cell-derived cancers (PTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma). No mutations were detected in medullary thyroid carcinomas, as described by Killela et al.3, nor in normal thyroid and benign lesions, such as goitre, adenomas or thyroiditis; this finding fits with previous studies that reported telomerase expression in malignant lesions and not in normal tissue or hyperplastic lesions8,9.

In cPTC, TERT mutations were associated with BRAF mutation, highlighting the coexistence of activation of BRAF and TERT, previously reported in melanoma1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Our results reinforce the hypothesis of a link between BRAF activation and telomerase expression, which can be mediated by transcription factors binding to the newly created consensus binding sites, as previously advanced by Horn et al.1. Both in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma, it seems that a ‘background’ status of activated BRAF enhances the effects of TERT promoter mutation. Our results in TERT mRNA expression strengthen this assumption, showing, for the first time, an increased TERT expression in tumours harbouring BRAF and TERT mutation (Fig. 3). Further observational and mechanistic studies are needed to clarify these points. TERT alterations seem to constitute an early and frequent event in bladder cancer. These findings fit with the high prevalence of telomerase activity previously described in bladder tumours10. The recurrent hotspot mutations in TERT were advanced to be, in melanomas, induced by ultraviolet radiation2. Bladder is a target for several chemical carcinogens; it remains to be found whether TERT mutations can also result from the action of such agents. The identification of TERT mutations in urine may provide a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer. No TERT mutations were detected in kidney cancers, nor in 17 phaeochromocytoma and 36 GISTs. The underlying reasons for the tissue specificity of TERT mutations remain to be clarified. We can hypothesize that TERT mutations can be present in two settings. As described by Killela et al.3, TERT mutations can be relevant in tissues with relative low rates of self-renewal, which fits with our findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas where they are associated with the older age of the patients. On the other hand, these mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, bladder and tongue1–3. In summary, our data identify TERT mutations as common events in human cancers and support the assumption that TERT promoter mutations may be one of the mechanisms that underlies telomerase reactivation in several types of human tumours.  Introduction The telomere sequences at the chromosomal ends, composed of tandem repeats of TTAGGG, are protected by a number of molecules that constitute the capping Shelterin complex [1 ;  2]. The incomplete replication due to limitations of the process, called ‘end-replication problem’, results in shortening of telomeres in each successive mitotic cell division that eventually leads to replicative senescence referred to as the ‘Hayflick limit’ [3; 4 ;  5]. Maintenance of telomere repeat length is dependent on sustained expression of telomerase holoenzyme that adds de novo repeat units at the end of each replication cycle [ 6 ;  7]. Progressive attrition of telomeres is also defined as one of the hallmarks of aging of organisms [ 8 ;  9]. Cancer cells, characteristically, acquire infinite capability to divide through maintenance of telomeres by sustained expression of telomerase or in its absence by an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism [ 10; 11; 12; 13; 14 ;  15••].  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase that together with a RNA component, TERC, maintains genomic integrity by telomere elongation [ 16]. Though TERT and TERC are sufficient for in vitro telomerase activity, the in vivo telomerase functioning requires additional components that associate with TERT and TERC, to form the holoenzyme [ 17 ;  18]. Those include dyskerin (DKC), NOP10 ribonucleoprotein (NOP10), GAR1 ribonucleoprotein homolog (yeast) (GAR1), NHP2 ribonucleoprotein (NHP2), reptin and pontin [ 11; 19; 20; 21 ;  22].  Deregulation of telomerase has been shown to be a ubiquitous feature in human cancers with over 90% of cancers showing an upregulation of the enzyme [11; 23 ;  24]. The telomerase activity is dependent on a number of factors, regulated at various stages, which include gene transcription, mRNA splicing, maturation and modifications of TERT and TERC, transport and localization of those components and assembly of active telomerase ribonucleoprotein to telomeres [ 4; 5; 16; 20; 21; 25; 26 ;  27]. The catalytic component TERT acts as a determinant of telomerase activity and its transcription is repressed in most of the somatic cells with the exception of proliferative cells of self-renewing tissues [ 28; 29 ;  30]. An increased expression of TERT has been consistently demonstrated to be a fundamental requirement for cellular transformation [ 4; 31; 32; 33; 34• ;  35].  The mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancers had been attributed to several mechanisms including epigenetic deregulation as well as genetic amplification of the locus containing TERT gene [ 36 ;  37]. In the absence of any evidence of a definite mechanism, the telomerase activity in tumor cells has been attributed to the assumption of stem cells being the progenitors in all cancers [38]. The normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retain telomerase throughout lifetime replication thus abrogating a requirement for a positive selection [6]. The recently discovered TERT promoter mutations add a new dimension to the acquisition of telomerase activity in human cancers. In this review we provide an overview and possible implications of the newly discovered mutations in the promoter of the TERT gene in a wide range of cancers.  Structure and regulation of the TERT promoter The human TERT gene is located on chromosome 5p15.33 and the promoter region of the gene is considered to be the most important regulatory element for telomerase expression. The TERT promoter contains binding motifs for several factors that regulate the gene transcription and distinctly lacks a TATA box or a similar sequence [ 39; 40; 41; 42 ;  43]. The core promoter region consists of 260 base pairs with several transcription-factor binding sites that include E-boxes where c-Myc has been confirmed to bind and activate the transcription [ 44; 45; 46; 47 ;  48]. BRCA1 in conjunction with N-Myc interacting protein (Nmi) forms a complex with c-Myc and inhibits TERT promoter activity, that property is lost in some mutant forms of BRCA1 [ 49]. Other sequence elements in TERT promoter include GC-boxes, which are binding sites for zinc finger transcription factor, Sp1 [ 4 ;  45]. Transcription of the TERT gene is also regulated by various hormones, cytokines and oncogenes [ 45]. Several repressors of the TERT transcription are also known. p53 has been shown to downregulate TERT transcription in a Sp1-dependent manner [ 50]. Ets transcription factors that comprise over 30 members are prominently associated with telomerase activation [ 42 ;  51]. Ets2 has been shown to form a complex with c-Myc in a breast cancer cell line [ 44 ;  51]. Ets transcription factors are also shown to be stimulated by oncogenes EGF, Her2/Nez, Ras and Raf [ 52 ;  53]. The activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors are known to account for cellular immortalization through induction of TERT transcription [ 54]. The high GC content around the transcription start site of the TERT promoter confers epigenetic regulation through methylation and chromatin remodeling [ 37 ;  55].  TERT promoter mutations in human cancers A discovery of a high-penetrant disease-segregating causal germline mutation in a melanoma family and highly specific and recurrent somatic mutations in tumors from unrelated patients in the TERT promoter has likely provided a definite mechanism for cancer-specific TERT activation [ 56•• ;  57••]. Two independent studies using diverse approaches discovered non-coding mutations, mainly at two residues, within the core promoter region of the TERT gene. One study was based on the identification of a causal gene mutation in a large melanoma pedigree where affected individuals presented a severe form of the disease with an early age of onset. The linkage analysis identified a 2.2 megabase telomeric region on chromosome 5p that included TERT along with more than 80 other genes [ 56••]. Sequencing of the entire stretch of DNA region in the family resulted in identification of a disease segregating A > C (T > G) single base change at −57 bp (Chr 5: 1,295,161 hg19 coordinate) from ATG start site. The germline mutation was present in affected and absent in unaffected individuals in the family with the exception of one. Subsequent screening of cell lines derived from melanoma metastases from unrelated patients led to the detection of recurrent and mutually exclusive somatic mutations at two residues −124 and −146 from the ATG start site in the TERT promoter [ 56••]. Serendipitously, an independent study using a whole genome sequencing approach also reported the recurrent somatic TERT promoter mutations at the same positions [ 57••]. Other mutations detected in TERT promoter included the CC > TT tandem mutations at −124/−125 and −138/−139 bp from ATG start site. The germline and somatic mutations in the non-coding part of the TERT gene were defined by common salient features. One of the underlying features included a de novo creation of CCGGAA/T general binding motifs for E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) transcription factors, which differed from pre-existing GGAA/T Ets binding sites within the TERT promoter ( Figure 1). The somatic mutations at both positions being C > T and the additional detection of CC > TT tandem mutations in a proportion of tumors augmented the evidence for the UV-origin of tumor specific nucleotide changes in melanoma as shown previously in studies based on whole genome sequencing [58•]. Interestingly, the mutations detected in the TERT promoter in melanoma were more frequent than those in the BRAF gene.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, ... Figure 1.  Schematic representation of a part of the TERT promoter that contains residues, which are affected by a germline mutation in a melanoma family at the position −57 bp and recurrent somatic mutations at the positions −124 and −146 bp from the ATG start site. The mutations create CCGGAA/T binding motif for Ets/TCF transcription factors that results in an increased TERT expression. Pre-existing binding sites for other transcriptions factors are shown above the sequence. Figure options It was also observed that the TERT promoter mutations tend to occur more often than expected by chance in tumors with either BRAF mutations (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–8.2) or with concomitant alterations in both BRAF and CDKN2A (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.4–13.8) [ 56••]. BRAF mutations, due to occurrence and role in development of melanocytic nevi, are considered as the driver genetic lesions in melanoma [ 56••; 59• ;  60]. The loss of CDKN2A has been suggested to play a role in the escape of melanocytes from BRAF induced senescence [61]. The acquisition of TERT promoter mutations can be hypothesized to facilitate stabilization of the transformed genome through reversal of telomeric loss. Most melanocytic nevi carry BRAF mutations, whereas TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A alterations are detected only in primary melanoma and beyond [ 56•• ;  62].  Bonafide of newly discovered non-coding mutations in the TERT promoter was established by the detection in cancers other than melanoma [ 63••]. The frequency of the mutations seems to vary between cancer types (Table 1). The highest frequencies of the TERT promoter mutations have so far been reported, besides melanoma, in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, glioma, urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder, basal and squamous cell carcinoma of skin, liver cancer and others [ 63••; 64; 65; 66; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75 ;  76]. The mutations occur in other cancer types as well, albeit, at low frequencies [ 63•• ;  67]. Based on the prevalence in different cancer types it has been hypothesized that the TERT promoter mutations mainly occur in tumors that are derived from tissues with low rates of self-renewal [ 63•• ;  77]. Unlike melanoma and other skin related malignancies, no tumor from the cancers affecting internal organs carried CC > TT tandem mutations in the TERT promoter with the exception of that at the positions −138/−139 bp from ATG start site in bladder cancer. The tandem mutation reported so far in 4 of the 1231 bladder tumors could also be generated by a single-base mutation at −138 bp as the base change at −139 bp has been reported as a rare polymorphism represented by rs35550267 [ 56••; 65 ;  66]. The differences in mutational pattern in cancer types are known to reflect etiological divergences and the C > T base change in tumors can also be attributed to APOBEC cytidine deaminase expression in cancer development [ 78•• ;  79••].

Table options Functional aspects of TERT promoter mutations The high recurrence, specificity and gain of function support that the non-coding TERT promoter mutations are driver rather than passenger events in cancer development. The functional relevance of the mutations was indicated by the basic reporter assays that showed 2–4-fold increased promoter activity [ 56••; 57•• ;  80••]. Tumors from thyroid cancers, primary glioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma and liver cancers with TERT promoter mutations were associated with higher gene expression than those without mutations [ 67; 69; 72 ;  74]. Though limited at the moment, the available data do indicate a tendency of the TERT promoter mutations being present in specific clinical and phenotypic subtypes and appear to be associated with adversarial forms of the disease. While in medulloblastomas the TERT promoter mutations were inversely associated with increased OTX2 expression; in primary adult glioma, the mutations occurred mainly in conjunction with EGFR amplification [ 69]. Glioma patients with TERT promoter mutations showed an association with poorer survival than patients without mutations; in thyroid cancer, mutations are reportedly more frequent in advanced thyroid cancers than in papillary thyroid cancers [ 63••; 70 ;  71].  The studies on bladder cancer consistently showed that TERT promoter mutations are the most frequent lesions with even distribution across all stages and grades [ 65; 66 ;  80••]. Intriguingly, an observed interaction has raised a possibility of eventual use of the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with a common polymorphism within the sequence as biomarkers in bladder cancer. The data from bladder cancer showed that the variant allele of a common polymorphism at −245 bp from ATG start site in the TERT promoter acts as a modifier of the effect of TERT promoter mutations on patient survival and disease recurrence [ 80••]. Bladder cancer patients with TERT promoter mutations in tumors showed almost two-fold decreased survival and increased disease recurrence in the absence but not in the presence of the variant allele for the rs2853669 polymorphism [ 80••]. Mechanistic support for the observation was provided by the fact that mutations result in de novo creation of Ets/TCF binding motifs; the variant allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism, on the contrary, disrupts a preexisting non-canonical Ets2 binding site in the proximal region of the TERT promoter, adjacent to an E-box [ 44].  The occurrence of highly specific TERT promoter mutations indicates a strong selection pressure for the gene over-expression on path to cellular transformation. Increased telomerase production has been demonstrated to promote cancer progression in an animal model [ 81•]. The effect of the promoter mutations on TERT expression can be tenable only in the presence of Ets/TCF transcription factors that can specifically bind to the de novo sites created by the mutations. Some of the Ets/TCF transcription factors are downstream targets of MAPK pathway, where BRAF is a prominent intermediate [ 82; 83 ;  84]. Whether in melanoma activated BRAF is a driving force in selection of TERT promoter mutations remains to be determined. Nevertheless, expression of Ets transcription factors is ubiquitous in melanoma and other cancers [ 85 ;  86].  Many studies have stressed the function of the TERT gene beyond its role in maintenance of the telomere; therefore the mutations in the TERT promoter can affect non-canonical processes associated with TERT [ 87; 88; 89; 90 ;  91]. TERT acts as a modulator of Wnt-b-catenin signaling pathway and induces stem cell characteristics in glioma; TERT also regulates expression of NF-kB, a master regulator of inflammation [ 92•; 93 ;  94]. TERT was shown to be important for proliferation of p53-negative cells through ATR mediated stabilization of ETV1, which binds downstream of the transcriptional start site [95]. Other non-canonical functions of TERT include enhanced cell proliferation, decreased apoptosis, regulation of DNA damage responses, chromatin state and increased cellular proliferation life span [ 96; 97 ;  98]. The effect of the mutations beyond transcription also remains a probability. The human TERT promoter contains G-rich sequence and has potential for G-quadruplex formation that can potentially be targeted to regulate gene transcription [ 99]. G-quadruplexes have been also implicated in inhibition of telomerase and control of gene expression [100].  Conceptual advancement and therapeutic possibilities The TERT promoter mutations are thought to represent a conceptual advancement in the sense that those instead of altering an encoded protein modulate transcriptional regulation and represent first evidence of driver alterations in so called ‘dark matter’ of the human genome [ 101• ;  102]. A host of germline variants discovered through genome wide association studies contribute to the susceptibility of various diseases through transcriptional deregulation [103]. While TERT promoter mutations represent novel findings in human cancer, alterations in components associated with telomerase assembly, telomere protection or telomere recruitment are known to impact stem cell function and lifespan in mammals through various disorders [ 104 ;  105].  Several strategies of therapeutic telomerase inhibition including small molecular inhibitors, immunotherapy, gene therapy, telomere and telomerase-proteins in different cancers have entered clinical trial [106]. It will be interesting to see if the TERT promoter mutations, that increase gene expression, influence the current on-going research on targeted therapeutics or if the use of telomerase inhibitors in conjunction with kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib or similar small molecules in melanoma can alleviate recurrent resistance [ 107]. Abstract Cell immortalization has been considered for a long time as a classic hallmark of cancer cells. Besides telomerase reactivation, such immortalization could be due to telomere maintenance through the “alternative mechanism of telomere lengthening” (ALT) but the mechanisms underlying both forms of reactivation remained elusive. Mutations in the coding region of telomerase gene are very rare in the cancer setting, despite being associated with some degenerative diseases. Recently, mutations in telomerase (TERT) gene promoter were found in sporadic and familial melanoma and subsequently in several cancer models, notably in gliomas, thyroid cancer and bladder cancer. The importance of these findings has been reinforced by the association of TERT mutations in some cancer types with tumour aggressiveness and patient survival. In the first part of this review, we summarize the data on the biology of telomeres and telomerase, available methodological approaches and non-neoplastic diseases associatedwith telomere dysfunction. In the second part, we review the information on telomerase expression and genetic alterations in the most relevant types of cancer (skin, thyroid, bladder and central nervous system) on record, and discuss the value of telomerase as a new biomarker with impact on the prognosis and survival of the patients and as a putative therapeutic target. Keywords Telomerase . TERT . Promoter . Mutations . Biomarker . Cancer Telomeres and telomerase in germinative and somatic tissues Normal somatic cells are not immortal and dispose of a predetermined limited number of divisions, a phenomenon known as the Hayflick limit. In 1961, Leonard Hayflick demonstrated that in cell cultures, a population of normal human fetal cells could divide around 40 to 60 times before entering into senescence [44]. At the time, the limited replication potential of somatic cells was not fully understood. Years later, the pioneering research of Nobel Prize winners Elizabeth Blackburn, Jack Szostak and Carolyn Greider identified a refined mechanism by which telomeres are shortened at each round of cell division creating a replication limit [9, 36, 116]. Currently, it is well established that telomeres are João Vinagre, Vasco Pinto and Ricardo Celestino contributed equally to the manuscript. J. Vinagre : V. Pinto : R. Celestino : M. Reis : H.

The main function of telomeres is to preserve chromosome integrity and genome stability by preventing the chromosome end from degradation [41, 85]. At each cell division, the telomeric DNA is diminished and telomeres become progressively shorter. Eventually, this loss leads to a stop in cell division that forces cell senescence or cell death. This telomere-based mechanismhas been proposed to serve as the “clock” that controls the number of times each cell can divide [41, 85]. In order to achieve immortalization, cells need to overcome the aforementioned barrier. There are two major pathways cells use for maintain telomere lengthening; they either reactivate telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein polymerase, which elongates telomeres by adding hexameric 5′-TTAGGG-3′ tandem repeats to the chromosomal ends at the ends, or take advantage of a non-telomerase-dependent (alternative) mechanism, known as ALT [21, 59]. Reactivation of telomerase is present in up to 90 % of human cancers, and it allows proliferative cancer cells to maintain telomere length [65]. The remaining 10 to 15 % of human cancers do not have detectable telomerase activity, and a subset of such cases maintain telomere length relying on the ALT mechanism [21]. Heaphy and colleagues performed a comprehensive survey on ALT phenotype in 6,110 primary tumours from 94 different cancer subtypes and observed the presence of ALT in 3.7 % of all tumour specimens but its absence in all benign neoplasms and normal tissues [46]. In this study, the ALT phenotype was identified for the first time in medulloblastoma, oligodendroglioma, schwannoma and glioblastoma [46]. Later on, Heaphy and colleagues demonstrated that ATRX or DAXX mutations are closely associated with the development of ALT in pancreatic endocrine tumours whereas ATRX mutations lead to ALT phenotype in cancers of the central nervous system [45]. Benign neoplasms and normal somatic cells apparently lack telomerase activity but a high level of telomerase activity can be detected in germ cells and in stem cells of selfrenewing tissues [41]. Some putative stem cells, such as the main cells of thyroid solid cell nests, also express telomerase, as we have previously reported [95, 101]. Most cells that need that to escape telomere shortening rely on the reactivation of telomerase. The telomerase complex comprises several components, the most important being the telomerase RNA component (TERC), the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic subunit (TERT) and dyskerin (DKC1 gene) [22, 83, 87]. It was shown in telomerase-negative cells, such as differentiated epithelial cells or human fibroblasts [33], that TERT is the only component necessary to restore the activity of the telomerase complex. The TERT gene is located on chromosome 5 and includes 16 exons that span a 35-kb region. The core promoter of telomerase includes 330 base pairs upstream of the start site, is located in a GC-rich region and contains transcript sites/consensus for transcription elements, indicating a high level of regulation by multiple factors [23] at transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level [22]. Methods to evaluate telomeres length and telomerase activity As mentioned above, telomere length is maintained and higher levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells than in normal somatic cells. The interest in the detection of telomerase activity and/or in telomere length measurement has been increasing since it can represent a powerful tool for the diagnosis of telomerase-related diseases as well as for the understanding of cancer etiopathogenesis and, hopefully, for improving cancer treatment. In order to evaluate the two aforementioned features, several methods and approaches to measure telomere length, telomerase messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and telomerase enzymatic activity have been developed [113]. Herein, we merely provide a summary of the methods available; for a more detailed review, the reader is referred to references [46] and [115]. The traditional telomere restriction fragment (TRF) analysis measures the average length of all telomeres present in a cell population and is the most used technique for evaluating telomere length [4]. Based on Southern blotting, TRF involves the use of restriction enzymes to digest genomic DNA and a hybridization step with a telomeric probe [60]. Additional techniques available include: STELA (single telomere elongation length analysis), a very accurate method that can only be used on a sample with a limited number of cells; quantitative PCR, less time consuming but less accurate [7]; Q-FISH (quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization) which allows specific measurement of chromosome ends with high resolution [20]; and, finally, Flow FISH, a very accurate method that evaluates cells in suspension [5]. The detection of telomerase is mainly based on assays that evaluate telomerase enzymatic activity [64, 129]. Refinement of these techniques led to a sensitive technique, the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP). TRAP assay includes the preparation of a protein extract by cell lysis and the addition of a labelled oligonucleotide substrate along with dNTPs, followed by PCR. In the first step of the reaction, if telomerase is active in the extract, it adds a number of telomeric repeats onto the 3′ end of a labelled substrate oligonucleotide; in the second step, the extended products are amplified by PCR using primers, which generates a ladder of products with 6-base increments starting at 50 nucleotides: 50, 56, 62, 68, etc. [59]. TRAP is the most used technique to evaluate telomerase activity due to its high sensitivity but it also has some limitations: it is very time consuming and can generate false-negative results if the PCR step fails [64]. Recent improvements in the TRAP technique avoid the use 120 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 of radioactive nucleotides [115]; other efforts have been made to refine the protocol in an attempt to still improve its sensitivity and to increase its reliability [113, 129]. Telomerase in degenerative diseases Three human diseases—dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anaemia (AA) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)—are associated to mutations in genes that code for the telomerase components, either TERC or TERT, as well for the following telomerase-associated proteins: DKC1, telomerase Cajal body protein 1, TCAB1 (WRP53 gene), NOLA2 protein (NHP2 gene) and NOP10 protein (NOLA3 gene) [79]. Additionally, one of the six proteins that compose the shelterin complex— TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TIN2 gene)—has also been associated with autosomal-dominant DC, Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome, Revesz syndrome and AA. Furthermore, some alterations affect proteins which do not have a direct impact on telomerase but concern the telomere such the telomere maintenance complex component 1 protein (CTC1 gene) that is associated to Coats plus syndrome, which is a formof cerebroretinalmicroangiopathy with calcifications and cysts. Finally, mutations of the regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 (RTEL1 gene) have been identified in patients with severe autosomal recessive DC [35] (Table 1). DC is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a typical triad of clinical manifestations: skin hyperpigmentation, oral leukoplakia and nail dystrophy [26]. The majority of cases (>80 %) occur in children and are diagnosed usually about the age of ten when the children start presenting bone marrow failure together with the previously described clinical triad. Other symptoms that include indicators of premature ageing, such as pulmonary diseases, dental abnormalities and alopecia, are present in 15–25 % of the cases [79]. Within the DC spectrum, there is the Hoyeraal Hreidarsson syndrome, a multisystemic disorder characterized by mental retardation, microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, immunodeficiency and AA [51]. The Revesz syndrome that is characterized by bilateral exudative retinopathy, bone-marrow hypoplasia, nail dystrophy, fine hair, cerebellar hypoplasia and growth retardation is also present in the DC disease spectrum [108]. DC is a genetically heterogeneous disease; to date, there are nine genes associated with DC and all of them contribute to telomere maintenance/protection or telomerase function, thus explaining the excessively short telomeres of DC patients. The group of DC genes encompasses the core telomerase component TERT and TERC and the telomerase complex proteins coded by DKC1, WRAP53, NOP10 and NHP2 genes. Other genes include the shelterin complex TIN2 gene, CTC1 and RTEL1 genes [35] (Table 1). AA is a rare and severe bone marrow disorder characterized by hypocelullar bone marrow and low blood cell counts [109]. Similarly to DC, the cases of AA arise from scarcity of haematopoietic progenitor and stem cells [17]. Since patients have shorter telomeres than matched controls, telomerase components constitute an attractive target for genetic screening. Mutations have been detected in the coding sequence of telomerase core components TERT and TERC (Table 1). Occasionally, AA can develop slowly and appear as an atypical form of DC due to bone marrow failure over time [31]. IPF is a rapidly progressive disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and different degrees of penetrance. The symptoms that characterize the disease are chronic cough and shortness of breath due to fibrotic lesions and scarring of the lungs [40]. IPF can co-exist in patients with AA and DC [35]. Like in the aforementioned disorders, IPF patients also have shorter telomeres than age-matched controls [17]. TERT and TERC telomerase component mutations have been found in familial forms of IPF [107].

Most of them are haematological disorders, such as myelodysplatic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [35]. In cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, mutations are considered an extremely rare event and were described in TERC coding region and its promoter [17]. The same mutation, which ablates a transcription factor binding site in the TERC promoter, has also been detected in a case of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria [17]. Additional information regarding mutations in degenerative disorders is summarized in Table 1, and further information can be retrieved on the telomerase disease database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/). Telomerase promoter mutations and cancer It has been known for 20 years that high levels of telomerase activity can be detected in cancer cells [59]; this contrasts with the fact that mutations affecting the telomerase coding region appear to be very uncommon in cancer [4]. A rare example of neoplasia presenting mutations in the coding region of telomerase is acute myeloid leukaemia in which few TERT mutations have been identified [17]. However, it should be taken into account that this form of leukaemia can arise from AA and myelodysplatic syndromes in which TERT mutations have been detected [17]. Published simultaneously in the beginning of 2013, two different studies reported mutations in the promoter of the telomerase gene inmelanoma [50, 53].We and others reported the presence of recurrent somatic mutations in the telomerase promoter in cancers of the central nervous system (43–51 %), bladder (59–66 %), hepatocellular carcinoma (59 %), thyroid (follicular cell-derived tumours) (10 %), skin (melanoma, 29– 73 %) and tumours originated from tissues with relatively low rates of self-renewal [58, 75, 88, 121]. Additionally, other studies reported the association of telomerase promoter mutations to other types of tumours, including atypical fibroxantoma (93 %), pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (76 %) [39], bladder cancer (65 %) [1, 54], basal cell carcinoma (78 %), squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (50 %) [110] and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary [124]. In Tables 2 and 3, we summarize the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in human cancers with a high percentage of mutations and in human cancers with absent or low frequency of TERT promoter mutations, respectively. The in vitro biological assessment of the functional consequence of these mutations, studied by promoter luciferase assay, revealed that their presence results in a two to fourfold increase in telomerase expression [50, 53]. Since previously published studies reported high levels of TERT expression in the set of tumours with TERT promoter mutations [70, 78, 111], it is likely that such alterations may represent one of the missing links between telomerase gene regulation/ reactivation. Telomerase promoter mutations in skin cancers Telomerase activity has been reported in normal skin by some authors [43, 118, 119] while other authors suggest that in normal skin, it is a rare event [52, 91]. Its activation in the epidermis may be related with the need for cell proliferation and damage repair [11]. The shortening of telomeres, on the other hand, is believed to provide a barrier for epidermal cell proliferation (i.e. cancer) [11]. Telomerase activity has been reported in cutaneous melanomas, using the TRAP assay, with increasing values from normal skin to benign nevi and to dysplastic nevi and finally to melanoma [29]. An association between increased telomerase activity and worse prognostic features, namely, ulceration, vascular invasion, mitotic rate and Breslow thickness has been described in melanoma [18, 32, 81, 91, 100]. Furthermore, higher telomerase activity has also been associated with higher proliferation rate and early metastasis [100, 104]. The suppression of telomerase activity in melanoma cell lines induced cellular differentiation and reduced the metastatic ability [6, 30]. Longer telomere length has been linked with a higher number of nevi per patient and an increased risk for cutaneous melanoma development [2, 8, 42, 86]. It was proposed that shorter telomere length in nevi limits proliferation and promotes senescence, protecting against malignant transformation [41, 86]. At variance with the aforementioned reports, Burke and colleagues suggested that telomere length can also be influenced by CDKN2A mutational status (a high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene), sun exposure and pigmentation phenotype and therefore cannot be considered a biomarker to predict melanoma risk per se [12]. Two seminal papers reported high frequency of TERT promoter mutations in familial and sporadic melanoma [50, 53]. In the study from Horn and colleagues, a melanomaprone family was investigated through linkage and NGS and a germ-line disease-segregating mutation was identified in the telomerase promoter [50]. Further confirmation was obtained from the same group in a series of cell lines derived from metastatic melanomas, respective metastases and matched primary melanomas that revealed a higher frequency of the mutations in the metastases (74, 85 and 33 %, respectively) [50]. Huang and colleagues took a different approach, data mining of whole genome sequencing data, publicly available. They detected the presence of promoter mutations in 89 % of melanoma cases [53]. The mutations clustered mostly, but not exclusively, in two hotspots that are located at −146 and 122 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 −124 bps distance upstream of the start site ATG [53]. The detected mutations were cytidine to thymidine transitions at a dipyrimidine motif indicating a putative ultraviolet lightinduced damage signature. These mutations generate a new Table 2 Human cancers with high frequency (>5 %) of TERT promoter mutations Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Nervous system Astrocytoma (n=597) 96 (16) (7.7–25) [3, 57, 58, 63, 121] Glioblastoma (n=1103) 733 (66) (28–84) [3, 10, 57, 58, 77, 89, 121] Medulloblastoma (n=700) 154 (22) (19–42) [58, 63, 71, 102] Oligoastrocytoma (n=263) 116 (44) (25–53) [3, 57, 58, 63] Oligodendroglioma (n=318) 233 (73) (45–79) [3, 57, 58, 63, 121] Other tumours (n=792) 45 (5.7) (0–28) [34, 58, 63] Digestive system Gallbladder carcinoma (n=164) 14 (8.5) (0–9.1) [58, 98] Hepatocellular carcinoma (n=366) 206 (56) (44–59) [58, 88] Endocrine System Thyroid cancer Follicular carcinoma (n=207) 39 (19) (14–36) [74–76, 80, 121] Papillary carcinoma (n=1128) 132 (12) (7.5–25) [66, 74–76, 80, 121] Poorly differentiated carcinomas (n=97) 42 (43) (29–52) [66, 75, 80, 121] Anaplastic carcinoma (n=130) 57 (44) (33–50) [66, 74, 75, 80, 121] Hürthle cell carcinoma (n=61) 4 (6.6) (0–16) [66, 80, 121] Eye Conjunctival melanoma (n=42) 12 (29) (0–32) [38, 121] Head and neck Laryngeal carcinoma (n=235) 64 (27) - [97] Reproductive system Endometrial carcinoma (n=19) 2 (11) [58] Ovarian cancer Clear cell carcinoma (n=245) 39 (16) (16–17) [58, 124] Skin Basal cell carcinoma (n=270) 125 (46) (39–74) [37, 94, 110] Cutaneous melanoma (n=591) 215 (36) (12–71) [27, 47, 50, 53, 69, 94, 121] Mucosal melanoma (n=53) 7 (13) [27] Metastatic melanoma (n=92) 72 (78) (67–85) [27, 50] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=76) 32 (42) (9.1–50) [37, 58, 110] Soft tissue and pleura Atypical fibroxanthomas (n=27) 25 (93) [39] Chondrosarcoma (n=2) 1 (50) [58] Fibrosarcoma (n=3) 1 (33) [58] Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (n=38) 2(5.3) (0–6) [58, 62] Malignant pleural mesothelioma (n=71) 8 (11) [117] Myxoid liposarcoma (n=63) 48 (76) (74–79) [58, 62] Pleomorphic dermal sarcoma (n=34) 26 (76) [39] Solitary fibrous tumour (n=41) 6 (15) (13–20) [58, 62] Kidney and urinary tract Bladder carcinoma (n=1447) 1028 (71) (47–85) [1, 54, 58, 77, 99, 121, 125] Renal cell carcinoma (n=159) 12(7.5) (0–9.2) [121, 123, 125] Renal pelvic carcinoma (n=16) 10 (63) (60–64) [123, 125] Transitional carcinoma of the ureter (n=9) 1(11) [123] Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 123 Table 3 Human cancers with absent or very low frequency of TERT promoter mutations Cancer type Number of mutations (%) Range (%) References Breast Breast carcinoma (n=88) 0 – [58] Nervous system Spinal ependymoma (n=9) 0 – [58] Digestive system Colorectal adenocarcinoma (n=22) 0 – [58] Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (n=12) 0 – [58] Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (n=45) 0 – [58, 121] Gastric carcinoma (n=468) 2 (0.43) – [73, 98] Hepatoblastoma (n=3) 0 – [58] Pancreatic acinar carcinoma (n=25) 0 – [58] Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n=24) 0 – [58] Pancreatic endocrine tumour (n=68) 0 – [58] Endocrine system Medullary thyroid carcinoma (n=158) 0 – [58, 74, 75, 80, 121] Phaeochromocytoma (n=17) 0 – [121] Eye Ocular melanoma (n=25) 0 – [121] Uveal melanoma (n=118) 1 (0.85) (0–2.0) [25, 38, 121] Head and neck Esophageal adenocarcinoma (n=90) 0 – [120] Esthesioneuroblastoma (n=11) 0 – [58] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=405) 17 (4.2) (0–17) [50, 58, 128] Haematopoietic system Acute myeloid leukaemia (n=48) 0 – [58] Chronic lymphoid leukaemia (n=15) 0 – [58] Chronic myeloid leukaemia (n=6) 0 – [58] Reproductive system Ovarian cancer Endometrioid carcinoma (n=43) 0 – [124] High-grade serous carcinoma (n=80) 0 – [124] Low-grade serous carcinoma (n=41) 2 (4.9) (3.3–13) [58, 124] Prostate carcinoma (n=47) 0 – [58, 125] Testicular carcinoma (n=17) 0 – [125] Uterine cervix cancer Endocervical adenocarcinoma (n=25) 0 – [124] Squamous cell carcinoma (n=75) 3 (4.0) (3.7–4.5) [58, 124] Uterine corpus cancer Endometrioid carcinoma (n=24) 0 – [124] Leiomyosarcoma (n=22) 0 – [124] Serous carcinoma (n=12) 0 – [124] Soft tissues and pleura Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (n=7) 0 – [58] Alveolar soft part sarcoma (n=6) 0 – [62] Angiosarcoma (n=9) 0 – [62] Cholangiosarcoma (n=28) 0 – [58] Clear cell sarcoma (n=5) 0 – [62] Central/conventional chondrosarcoma (n=9) 0 – [58] Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (n=61) 0 – [62] 124 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 binding consensus for ETS/TCFs transcription factors (CCGG AA) [50, 53]. Moreover, it was demonstrated in vitro by luciferase assay that the presence of these mutations lead to a two to fourfold increase of the TERT promoter activity [54]. TERT promoter mutations were not detected in nevi [121] but in 13%of mucosalmelanomas [27]. In primary cutaneous melanomas, TERT promoter mutations were found to be associated with BRAF V600E mutations, worse prognostic features and shorter disease free and overall survival [94, 121]. In ocular melanomas, TERT promoter mutations were described in 0 to 32 % of conjunctival melanomas [25, 121]. Mutations were not detected in uveal melanomas [121]. At variance with the aforementioned data, Dono and colleagues observed a case of uveal melanoma harbouring a TERT promoter mutation that co-existed with GNA11 and EIF1AX mutations [25]. TERT promoter mutations are frequent in non-melanoma skin cancer, ranging from 39 to 74 % in sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCC) [37, 94, 110] and present in up to 50 % of cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [37, 110].Telomerase activity has been detected in BCC using TRAP assay both in tumour and tumour-free margins, varying between 20 and 100 %, with less activity in the latter [29]. In the tumour-free margins, telomerase activity was found to be more prevalent in sun-exposed skin [105, 119]. In SCC, the data are scarce: Ueda and colleagues found telomerase activity in 100%of the cases of a small series (n=8) [119]. Few studies have examined the association between telomere length and skin cancer [2]. Some studies found no significant association between telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, either in BCC (two independent sets) [68] or in SCC [42, 68]. In contrast, other authors found that longer telomeres in PBL are protective for BCC [2, 86] and SCC [2]. Telomere length has also been evaluated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showing that higher telomere length in BCC is significantly higher than in SCC [93]. Telomerase promoter mutations in thyroid carcinomas Thyroid tissue is a conditionally renewing tissue that proliferates rarely in adult life. In line with this, telomerase activity in normal thyroid samples is almost absent, being detected in less than 7%of cases [16, 114]. On the other hand, telomerase activity was consistently reported in a specific population of thyroid cells—the solid cell nests (SCNs) which are considered to represent embryonic remnants of the ultimobranchial body [95, 101]. Thyroid carcinomas apparently display less frequent telomerase activation than most human carcinomas. Awide range of frequencies have been reported [16]; in average, it seems that two thirds of thyroid carcinomas display telomerase activation that is more frequent in the undifferentiated (anaplastic) than in differentiated carcinomas [16]. When the results obtained by several authors are combined, telomerase activity occurs in 48 % of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 71 % of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC). A TERT copy number gain was described in familial PTC [14], but this finding was not confirmed in another series [55]. A recent study by Capezzone and colleagues reported telomerase activity in most sporadic and familialmalignant thyroid tumours as well as in some adenomas [15]. Telomerase activity was not observed in hyperplastic nodules or in normal thyroid tissue from patients with sporadic PTC [15]. In summary, the aforementioned findings suggest that telomerase activity may be associated with a more aggressive clinical behaviour of thyroid tumours. Recently, somatic mutations in the promoter region of TERT were reported in thyroid tumours [66, 74, 75, 121].

This stepwise increase in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations from well to poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas was also reported in other studies [66, 74] (Table 2). TERT promoter mutations were not detected in normal thyroid tissue, benign lesions or medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Moreover, very few tumours with oncocytic features harbouring TERT promoter mutations have been reported, and no mutations were detected in a small series of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma nor in tumours from individuals exposed to the Chernobyl accident [58, 77, 121]. The majority (about 80 %) of mutated cases presented the −124G>A mutation. In PTC, TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in BRAF-mutated tumours than in BRAF wild-type tumours [74, 75, 80, 121]. The TERT promoter mutations were associated with increased mRNA expression, and this increase was particularly pronounced in tumours harbouring both BRAF and TERT promoter mutations [121]. Two studies analysed the relationship between TERT promoter mutations, clinico-pathological features and outcome. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with older age at diagnosis [74, 80], larger tumour size and higher stage [80]. TERT promoter mutations were also found to be an independent predictor of distant metastases and disease persistence at the end of follow-up in differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC) [80]. Patients with TERT promoter-mutated tumours were submitted to more radioiodine treatments with higher doses as well as to other treatment modalities including surgery, external beam irradiation and/or treatment with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors [80]. TERT promoter mutations were significantly associated with disease-specific mortality in the whole FCDTC group; this association held true if the subgroups of patients with DTC, PTC or FTC were independently considered [80]. In DTC, the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations for disease-specific mortality was independent of age and gender [80]. Altogether, the aforementioned findings indicate that TERT promoter mutations are a major indicator of poor outcome in DTC. The two studies on record onMTC [59, 123] did not reveal TERT promoter mutations in this subtype of thyroid carcinoma. Telomerase promoter mutations in bladder carcinomas The putative role of telomerase in bladder carcinoma (BC) has been a matter of interest in the last two decades. Using TRAP assay, telomerase activity has been evaluated in BC; telomerase activity was detected in the majority of the studied tumours in contrast to the absence of activity in the respective normal counterpart samples [70, 90]. In some series, telomerase activity was associated with lower grade and lower stage BC [84, 90]. Other studies pointed out that both telomerase activity [70] and telomerase expression [126] are associated with higher stage and higher grade [70, 90]. Preliminary evidence obtained in cell lines suggest that BC might have TERT promoter mutations [53]. These early results motivated us and others to search for similar events in bladder tumour samples. Similar to cell lines, the same TERT promoter mutations were detected frequently in BC, with a prevalence ranging from 47 to 85 % (Table 2) [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125]. These results rank TERT promoter mutations as one of the most frequent genomic events, possibly the most frequent, in BC [1, 54, 61, 77, 99, 121, 125]. TERT mutations were significantly more frequent among FGFR3 mutant tumours [1]. Wu and colleagues reported a significant co-occurrence of TERT promoter mutations and TP53/RB1 inactivating somatic mutations [125] indicating that both mutations may cooperatively contribute to the progression of BC [125]. Conflicting results have been reported on the association between TERT promoter mutations and clinical stage and/or grade of bladder tumours. Wu and colleagues found that TERT promoter mutations are more prevalent in muscle invasive (MI) than in non-muscle invasive (NMI) tumours and also more prevalent in BC patients with advanced tumour stages (T2–4) than in those with low stage tumours (Ta or T1) [125]. At variance with this, another report found no association between mutation status and stage or grade of BC [54]. Similar results were reported by Allory and colleagues who did not find any differences betweenNMI and MI BC in two independent sets of tumours [1]. Similarly to stage and grade, diverging results were obtained on the association between TERT promoter mutation and prognosis. One group reported that the survival rate of patients with TERT mutations was significantly lower than that of patients without mutations [125], whereas another group found no association between clinical outcome and mutation status [1]. An interesting observation was reported by Rachakonda and colleagues who proposed that a common polymorphism, rs2853669 within a pre-existing Ets2 binding site in the TERT promoter, acts as a modifier of the effect of the mutations on survival and tumour recurrence [99]. The patients with the mutation presented poorer survival in the absence than in the presence of the polymorphism. The mutation in the absence of the variant allele was highly associated with disease recurrence in patients with Tis, Ta and T1 tumours [99]. These results may help to explain some of the divergence reported in studies relating TERT promoter mutations and prognosis of patients with BC. As it was previously noticed, several observations support a model in which TERT somatic mutations are an early event in urothelial carcinogenesis, including their occurrence in a small fraction of subjects with precursor lesions, their presence in tumours of both papillary and invasive features and 126 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 their low level of intraindividual heterogeneity when analysing multiple tumour regions [1, 58]. TERT promoter mutations may potentially be used as urinary biomarker; several studies have already performed preliminary evaluations of the feasibility, sensibility and specificity of such procedure [1, 54]. Prospective studies based upon series are necessary to further assess the clinical utility of the detection of TERT promoter mutations in urine. Telomerase promoter mutations in central nervous system tumours Central nervous system (CNS) often have TERT promoter mutations competing favourably in this aspect with most other types of human cancer [58, 121]. Among CNS tumours, gliomas are those displaying by far the highest frequency of TERT mutations which can also be detected at lower frequencies in medulloblastoma and meningioma [63]. Within gliomas, the percentage of cases with TERT promoter mutations differs according to the histopathological type of tumour. TERT promoter mutations are detected in the majority of cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV] which is the most frequent and aggressive form of glioma and in oligodendrogliomas (WHO Grade II and III), in contrast to astrocytoma (WHO Grades I, II and III) and ependymoma (WHO Grades I, II and III), in which only a small percentage of the tumours harbour such mutations (Table 3) [63, 121]. Furthermore, the percentage of TERT promoter mutations in oligoastrocytomas, gliomas with a mixed origin, is intermediate between that of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas [58]. These findings fit with the reported data on telomerase activity in gliomas which is considerably higher in GBM(50– 89 %) and oligodendrogliomas (75–100 %), than in astrocytomas (0–45 %) [49, 67, 106]. The low frequency of TERT promoter mutations and telomerase activity in grades II and III astrocytomas can be explained by the high prevalence of ATRX mutations, one of the most frequent mutations in this type of glioma [56]. It is known that ATRX mutations trigger ALT in astrocytoma cells and it has been shown that this alternative mechanism is frequently activated in astrocytomas, allowing telomere maintenance without the need for telomerase reactivation [48]. In line with this, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in secondary GBMs (that arise from the progression of lower grade astrocytomas) is considerably lower than in primary GBMs (that appear de novo) [89]. TERT promoter mutations are rare in paediatric tumours of the CNS [63]. In medulloblastomas that typically develop in children, TERT promoter mutations are mainly detected in tumours of the group of older patients and are associated with sonic hedgehog and WNT mutations [102]. Upregulation of TERT expression in paediatric brain tumours was associated with hypermethylation of the TERT promoter, rather than with TERT promoter mutations [19]. These findings are consistent with the fact that the cells, from which paediatric CNS tumours are thought to originate, still have activated telomerase which obviates the need for activation of TERT through promoter mutation. Although ATRX and TERT promoter mutations provide an explanation for themaintenance of telomere length in most gliomas, TERT upregulation was also reported to occur in a subset of gliomas without TERT promoter mutations or ATRX mutations through an as yet unidentified mechanism [58]. Finally, it is worth noting that, previous to the discovery of TERT promoter mutations in gliomas, some studies had reported an association between SNPs in the TERT gene and an increased risk of glioma development [112, 127]. Telomerase promoter mutations in other tumour types In Tables 2 and 3, we have summarized the data on record on the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours from almost every site. For the sake of simplicity, we divided the tumours into those with a high frequency of mutations (>5 %, Table 2) and tumours with no mutations or with a very low frequency of TERT promoter mutations (<5 %, Table 3). Besides the tumour histotypes with high frequency of TERT promoter mutations described in the previous sections, there are others in which such mutations appear to be particularly prevalent: hepatocellular carcinoma (56 %), several soft tissue tumours histotypes (e.g. 93 % in atypical fibroxanthoma, 79 % in myxoid liposarcoma and 76 % in pleomorphic dermal sarcoma) and carcinoma of the renal pelvis (64 %) (Table 2). Tumour histotypes with intermediate frequencies of TERT promoter mutations include laryngeal carcinoma (27 %) and clear cell carcinoma of the ovary (16 %) (Table 2). The latter value contrasts with the absence or very low frequency of mutations in other ovarian carcinomas (absent in endometrioid carcinoma and in high-grade serous carcinoma) (Table 3) [124]. In clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, TERT promoter mutations tend to be mutually exclusive with the loss of protein expression of ARID1A, a tumour suppressor, and with PI3KCA mutation [124]. Since the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is involved in the activation of telomerase through phosphorylation, Wu and colleagues advanced that PI3KCA-activating mutations confer a growth advantage on cancer cells by overcoming replicative senescence [124]. At variance with other tumour models (gliomas, melanomas, follicular cell derived carcinoma and others), no associations with disease specific survival were observed for ovarian clear cell carcinoma [124]. There are also differences regarding the putative (early or late) timing of the occurrence of TERT promoter mutations in the oncogenic processes of the various tumour models. TERT promoter mutations seem to be present in two settings. As Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 127 described by Killela and colleagues, TERT promoter mutations can be relevant in tissues with relatively low rates of selfrenewal [58], an association that fits with the findings in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer and gliomas. In these two settings (thyroid cancer and gliomas), TERT promoter mutations are associated with a guarded prognosis of the patients harbouring the tumours and probably represent late events of the oncogenic process. On the other hand, TERT promoter mutations can also result from environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation and chemical carcinogens as suggested by their high frequency in melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and bladder and tongue carcinomas. In this second setting, TERT promoter mutations appear to be an early tumorigenic event and do not carry major prognostic value, with the exception of melanoma. Why clear cut differences exist in the frequency of TERT promoter mutations in tumours of the same system (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma versus pancreatic carcinoma) remains to be clarified, although there is enough evidence to claim that the high or low prevalence of the mutations appears to be histotype- rather than site-associated. For instance, the high frequency in transitional carcinoma of the bladder and renal pelvis is in contrast to low frequency/absence in kidney carcinoma and the extremely low frequency/absence in adenocarcinomas of every organ of the gastrointestinal tract (Tables 2 and 3). Telomerase as a therapeutic target Several therapy strategies have been suggested to control TERT expression in tumours, mainly using small molecule inhibitors, gene therapy approaches and immunotherapy (reviewed in [82]). Inhibition of enzymatic activity with small synthetic molecules allows the disruption of the replicative capacity of cancer cells; in this way, it is though that normal somatic cells will not be affected due to the absence of TERT activity. In vitro studies showed that BIBR1532, a noncompetitive inhibitor of both TERT and TERC [92], leads to cellular senescence reducing proliferation and telomere length [24] and is cytotoxic in high doses [28]. Additionally, a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of tumour cells treated with BIBR1532 was observed in a mouse xenograft model [24], with no adverse side effects and uncomplicated oral administration of the drug. BIBR1532 is one of the most promising TERT specific-inhibitors to date. Other small synthetic molecules—G-quadruplex ligands, such as BRACO19, RHSP4 and telomestatin—are promising drugs that can be used for TERT targeting therapies [103]. However, clinical testing of some of these molecules has been hampered due to the toxic characteristics of the compounds [82]. Cancer cells with TERT activity can be directly targeted by introducing suicide genes or oncolytic viruses driven by the TERT or TERC promoters, or the inhibition of TERT or TERC activity targeting their RNAs. In the latter strategy, antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs and ribozymes can be applied for inhibition of TERT activity. GRN163L (also known as imetelstat) is the most studied antisense oligonucleotide that causes TERT inhibition and telomere shortening in cancer cell lines derived from different organs [13]. This compound leads to apoptosis of cells and to inhibition of tumour growth, and it is being used in clinical trials of several cancer types [13]. DNA vaccines (immunotherapy) have been used to generate protective immunity against tumours in several models [96]. The presence of TERT activity in many human cancers turns TERT a tumour-associated antigen suitable for cancer immunotherapy. Contrary to other target antigens, as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and melanoma-associated antigen, TERT-based immunotherapy may be applied to a wide range of malignancies due to the highly frequent TERT-altered expression [122]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed tumour regression using TERT-based vaccination approaches (reviewed in [72]). Different peptides have been used to induce anti-TERT immune response [13] and vaccination using the I540–548 peptide showed anti-tumour responses in cancer [122]. Several preclinical studies using TERT peptides are being conducted (reviewed in [103]). GV-1001, GRNVAC 1 and Vx-001 are the most promising vaccines available to date. Future perspectives The implication of telomerase in human diseases has been studied for a long time and firmly established in a few models of degenerative diseases. In cancer, telomerase dysfunction has been perceived as a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis although the underlying mechanisms remained elusive. The recent identification of telomerase promoter mutations in several types of neoplasia fostered the respective research, and in less than a year, numerous studies have been published reporting similar alterations in many cancer models (Tables 2 and 3). In several relevant cancer types, telomerase promoter mutations seem to constitute a new biomarker for prognosis with potential applications in pre-surgical diagnosis and in the follow-up of the patients. Low-grade bladder cancers represent a good example on how such finding can represent an added value from a clinical standpoint. Up to 70 % of lowgrade non-invasive bladder tumours recur, and long-term cystoscopic surveillance is the current standard of care. This procedure is expensive and time consuming and carries significant morbidity. The non-invasive evaluation of telomerase promoter mutations in urine may provide diagnostic 128 Virchows Arch (2014) 465:119–133 information, independent of routine cytology, and most importantly, may identify low-grade tumours, which are difficult to identify by cytological examination alone. Whenever dealing with a recurrence, a non-invasive diagnostic test that also serves as a surveillance method will probably represent an attractive alternative for patients, taking into consideration the limitations of the technique. A preliminary evaluation of the diagnostic usefulness of the detection of TERT promoter mutations was already performed in urine samples, and the results indicate that such detection may serve as a biomarker of early disease and recurrence [1, 54]. Moving to a trendier subject, it seems extremely interesting to evaluate whether or not TERT promoter mutations can be detected in tumour-circulating DNA from cell-free fragments in body fluids. In the affirmative case, this process may represent a major advance in the follow-up of cancer patients. Despite the large amount of information collected in these recent years, more questions than answers remain at present with regard to the role of telomerase involvement in carcinogenesis. A novel mechanism for telomerase re-activation and/ or re-expression was discovered; this mechanism, together with ALT, represents the two major pathways for telomere length maintenance. Besides them, other mechanisms may modulate telomerase expression, such as novel forms of transcriptional regulation or epigenetic alterations. We think it is the appropriate time to study large series with robust clinicopathological data and to search for correlations that may establish or rule out the prognostic value of TERT promoter mutations in the various types of human cancer. Last but not least, cell and molecular biology studies are mandatory to understand the role(s) of telomerase in cancer cells that appear to go beyond the increased replicative potential (immortalization) and have impact also in metastatic capacities.  Malignant cells, like all actively growing cells, must maintain their telomeres, but genetic mechanisms responsible for telomere maintenance in tumors have only recently been discovered. In particular, mutations of the telomere binding proteins alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX) have been shown to underlie a telomere maintenance mechanism not involving telomerase (alternative lengthening of telomeres), and point mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene increase telomerase expression and have been shown to occur in melanomas and a small number of other tumors. To further define the tumor types in which this latter mechanism plays a role, we surveyed 1,230 tumors of 60 different types. We found that tumors could be divided into types with low (<15%) and high (≥15%) frequencies of TERT promoter mutations. The nine TERT-high tumor types almost always originated in tissues with relatively low rates of self renewal, including melanomas, liposarcomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, urothelial carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, medulloblastomas, and subtypes of gliomas (including 83% of primary glioblastoma, the most common brain tumor type). TERT and ATRX mutations were mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two genetic mechanisms confer equivalent selective growth advantages. In addition to their implications for understanding the relationship between telomeres and tumorigenesis, TERT mutations provide a biomarker that may be useful for the early detection of urinary tract and liver tumors and aid in the classification and prognostication of brain tumors.  Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that are required for chromosomal integrity. Several hundred nucleotides of telomere repeats cap each chromosomal end, and in the absence of telomerase activity, telomeres shorten with each cell division (1). Eventually, uncapped telomeres trigger cell death or senescence. Cancer cells seem to divide ad infinitum and therefore, require some telomere maintenance mechanism to avoid this fate. Because telomerase activity is generally higher in cancer cells than normal cells, it was originally believed that telomerase was somehow activated in cancer cells (2–6). However, it was subsequently realized that telomerase was only inactive in terminally differentiated cells and that normal stem cells in self-renewing tissues retained telomerase activity (1, 7–9). Because normal stem cells must replicate throughout the long lifetimes of mammals (which can be more than a century in humans), it is clear that such cells must also retain telomerase activity. Because normal stem cells are thought to be the progenitors of cancers, there would be no need to specifically activate telomerase in cancer cells; the enzyme was already active in the precursors, just as were the hundreds of other enzymes and proteins normally required for cell proliferation.  This view was challenged by the discovery of another mechanism for maintaining telomere length [i.e., alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)] (10–12). ALT occurs in the absence of telomerase activity and seems to be dependent on homologous recombination. It occurs in a particularly high fraction of certain tumor types, such as sarcomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and brain tumors, but rarely in most common tumor types, such as those tumor types of the colon, breast, lung, prostate, or pancreas (13). Why would cancer cells need ALT if telomerase activity was already constitutively active in their precursors? This question was highlighted by the discovery that many ALT cancers harbor mutations in alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) or death-domain associated protein (DAXX), genes encoding proteins that interact with each other at telomeres (10, 11). Presumably, the absence of functional ATRX/DAXX complexes permits the homologous recombination resulting in ALT. At minimum, these data were compatible with the ideas that there could be a selective advantage for genetic alterations that results in telomere maintenance and that telomerase is not indefinitely activated in all normal stem cell precursors of cancers.  Another challenge to the idea that genetic alterations were not required for telomerase activation in cancer was raised by the finding that mutations of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter occurred in ∼70% of melanomas and in a small number of tumor cell lines derived from various tissue types (14, 15). Importantly, only 5 of 110 cell lines derived from lung, stomach, ovary, uterus, or prostate cancers harbored TERT promoter mutations, whereas 19 mutations were found among 37 cell lines derived from various other tumor types. This situation is analogous to the situation for ALT, which is infrequently observed in common epithelial cancers but is observed more regularly in tumors derived from nonepithelial cells, particularly sarcomas and brain tumors (13).  These findings prompted us to formulate a hypothesis about the mechanisms responsible for telomerase activity in cancers. We suggest that there are two ways to maintain telomere lengths as cells divide: (i) through epigenetic regulation of telomerase activity, which occurs in stem cells of tissues that are rapidly renewing, and (ii) through somatic mutations that maintain telomere lengths, such as mutations in the TERT promoter or mutations in DAXX or ATRX. Those cancers that originate in tissues that are constantly self-renewing, such as cancers of the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract and skin or bone marrow, would be unlikely to harbor telomere-maintaining mutations, because telomerase is already epigenetically activated in their precursor cells. In contrast, tumors arising from cells that are not constantly self-renewing, such as neurons, glial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, islet cells, and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, might frequently harbor such mutations. A corollary of this hypothesis is that tumor types exhibiting high frequencies of ALT would also exhibit high frequencies of TERT mutations, and these mutations would be distributed in a mutually exclusive fashion. To test these hypotheses as well as answer other questions related to the role of TERT promoter mutations in various cancer types, we determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in a large number of tumors.  Go to: RESULTS We attempted to evaluate at least 20 individual specimens of common tumor types and fewer specimens of rare tumor types, depending on availability of specimens in our laboratories. In those tumor types in which our pilot studies showed a significant number of mutations, additional tumors were evaluated. Melanomas and tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus were excluded, because they had already been adequately evaluated in the seminal papers cited (14, 15). When primary tumors rather than cell lines were used, we ensured that the fraction of neoplastic cells was >50% through histopathologic examination of frozen sections of the tissue blocks used for DNA purification. In those cases in which the neoplastic content was <50%, we microdissected the lesions to enrich the neoplastic content to >50%. Primers were designed to amplify the region containing the two TERT mutations that were previously described—C228T and C250T—corresponding to the positions 124 and 146 bp, respectively, upstream of the TERT ATG start site (14, 15). The PCR fragments were then purified and analyzed by conventional Sanger sequencing.  In all, we evaluated TERT promoter mutations in 1,230 tumor specimens and identified 231 mutations (18.8%) (Table 1). C228T and C250T mutations accounted for 77.5% and 20.8% of the alterations, respectively (Dataset S1). Additionally, we detected four mutations that had not been observed previously: three C228A mutations and one C229A mutation (Dataset S1). All four of these mutations as well as a representative subset of the C228T and C250T mutations (n = 59) were somatic, as evidenced by their absence in normal tissues of the patients containing the mutations in their tumors.  Table 1. Table 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations The 1,230 tumors represented 60 tumor types. In 26 of these tumor types, at least 15 individual tumors were evaluated (comprising a total of 1,043 individual tumors) (Fig. 1). In the remaining tumor types, only a small number of samples (2–12) was available, in part because these tumor types are generally uncommon in Western populations (Table 1). Among the tumor types in which at least 15 individual tumors were available for study, a clear distinction could be made. Eighteen of these tumor types had only occasional TERT promoter mutations (zero to three mutations, comprising 0–15% of the tumors of each type) (Fig. 1). We classified these tumor types as TERT-low (TERT-L), because they had a low frequency of TERT promoter mutations. Eight other tumor types were classified as TERT-high (TERT-H) because of their relatively high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (16–83% of the tumors of each type).  Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Frequency of TERT promoter mutations; 15 or more tumors were analyzed in 26 tumor types. Gliomas are divided into primary GBM, astrocytoma (including astrocytoma grades II and III, as well as secondary GBM), and oligodendroglioma. The TERT-L tumor types included some of the most prevalent cancers, including epithelial tumors of the breast, prostate, thyroid, pancreas, gall bladder, uterus, and colon (as well as tumors of the lung, stomach, and esophagus based on prior studies) (14, 15) and leukemias. In fact, no TERT mutations were identified in any specimen of 30 tumor types that we studied, comprising a total of 546 tumors (Table 1). Some nonepithelial cancers, such as synovial sarcomas, chordomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, and ependymomas, were also TERT-L.  Eight TERT-H tumor types were identified (in addition to the previously described melanomas) (14, 15). These tumors included tumors of the CNS, transitional cell carcinomas of the urinary tract, hepatocellular carcinomas, myxoid liposarcomas, and oral cavity carcinomas. Although only a small number of TERT-H tumors (other than melanomas) were examined in previous studies (15), mutations in gliomas, hepatocellular, and oral cavity carcinomas were detected, which would be expected on the basis of the high frequency of mutation in these tumors types (Table 1).  Clinical and Molecular Correlations in TERT-H Tumors. Sarcomas. One of the highest frequencies of TERT promoter mutation was found in myxoid liposarcoma (19 of 24 tumors, 79% with mutation). Myxoid liposarcomas account for more than one-third of all liposarcomas and ∼10% of all adult soft tissue sarcomas (16). Patients are relatively young, with a peak age range between 30 and 50 y. At the genetic level, the most characteristic change is a t(12;16) (q13;p11) chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the FUS and DDIT3 genes (16, 17). The cellular origin of these tumors is unknown, but preadipocytic progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells have been implicated (18); after embryogenesis, the mitotic activity of these cells is thought to be low. Other sarcomas, also thought to originate from mesenchymal cells that do not self-renew in the absence of damage, were not TERT-H (Table 1). These sarcomas included synovial sarcomas (0% of 16 tumors) and osteosarcomas (4.3% of 23 tumors). Of note, myxoid liposarcomas have been previously shown to have a relatively high prevalence of ALT (24% of 38 tumors) (13, 19). The data, in aggregate, are compatible with the idea that myxoid liposarcomas almost always genetically activate telomere maintenance genes through either TERT promoter mutations or ALT.  Hepatocellular carcinomas. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and their incidence is increasing in the United States (20). Most HCCs in the United States are associated with Hepatitis B or C Virus infection, whereas others are associated with alcoholic cirrhosis; 44% of HCC samples that we evaluated harbored TERT promoter mutations (27/61). This finding makes TERT the most commonly mutated gene yet observed in this tumor type (21, 22). The mutations seemed to occur relatively early in tumorigenesis, because they were observed in 39% of stage I well-differentiated HCCs (Table S1). TERT mutations were observed in virally associated tumors as well as cases without any underlying liver disease at similar frequencies (Table S1). There was also no difference in the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations with respect to sex, age, or ethnicity (Table S1). ALT has been observed in 7% of 121 HCCs studied previously (13).  Urinary tract cancers. Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is the fourth most common type of cancer in American males. In 2013, over 73,000 patients will be diagnosed with bladder cancer leading to approximately 15,000 deaths in the US alone (23). Two-thirds of the 21 urothelial carcinomas of the bladder that we studied harbored TERT promoter mutations. We were also able to evaluate 19 urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, a much less common anatomic site for this histopathologic subtype of tumor. Nine of nineteen upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas harbored TERT mutations. TERT mutations are, therefore, the most frequently mutated genes yet identified in urothelial carcinoma of either the bladder or upper urinary tract (24). The prevalence of ALT in bladder cancers is very low (1% of 188 cancers) (13).  Head and neck cancers. Head and neck cancers are almost always squamous cell carcinomas and can occur throughout the oral cavity lining (mucous membranes of the cheek, hard and soft palate, tongue, supraglottis, etc.). It is the sixth most common cancer in the world, and 50,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2012. We identified TERT promoter mutations in 17% of 70 oral cavity cancers that we evaluated. However, the anatomic distribution of the cases with TERT promoter mutations was striking: 11 of 12 cancers with TERT promoter mutations were in the oral tongue, although only 23 of 70 total cases originated in the oral tongue (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed) (Table S2). The basis for this extraordinary selectivity is curious given the shared characteristics of the squamous epithelium lining the tongue and other parts of the head and neck, including the oral cavity. Moreover, we evaluated 22 squamous cell carcinomas of another site (the cervix) and found only one TERT mutation (4.5%) (Table 1). Most cervical squamous cell carcinomas and a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus, which can activate telomerase by expressing E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (25). These findings raise the possibility that human papillomavirus infection and TERT mutation may be alternative mechanisms to activate telomerase among squamous cell carcinomas. We were unable to test correlations between TERT promoter mutations and HPV status or other clinical parameters because of the small number of patients with available data (Table S2). There have been no ALT cases identified among 70 head and neck cancers, including 41 oral cavity cancers (13).  Medulloblastomas. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (26). TERT mutations occurred in 21% of 91 medulloblastomas that we evaluated. As with the oral cavity cancers, TERT mutations were not distributed randomly among the medulloblastoma patients. Although medulloblastomas are usually diagnosed at a young age, those medulloblastomas with TERT mutations were diagnosed at a considerably older age (median = 6 vs. 16 y, P = 0.0012, t test assuming unequal variances, two-tailed) (Fig. S1A). This observation has important implications for understanding the basis for the selectivity of the tumor types harboring TERT promoter mutations (Discussion); 45 of 90 patients had been assessed previously for orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene amplification and expression, and alterations in this transcription factor are known to correlate with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of medulloblastoma (27). OTX2 expression was >100-fold higher in medulloblastoma patients without TERT promoter mutations than in those patients with TERT promoter mutations (note the log scale in Fig. S1B). The high levels of OTX2 expression were usually the result of OTX2 gene amplification (Fig. S1C). The association of TERT promoter mutations with an older age at diagnosis and a lack of OTX2 overexpression raises the possibility that TERT mutations occur in a specific clinical and molecular subtype of medulloblastoma. The most likely molecular subtype of medulloblastoma that may be enriched for TERT mutations is the noninfant sonic hedgehog subtype, which is characterized by an older age at diagnosis and lower expression of OTX2 (28, 29). Larger studies will be needed to make this association more definitive. ALT has been observed in 7% of 55 medulloblastomas studied previously (13).  Gliomas. Gliomas are the most common CNS tumor type and accounted for >14,000 deaths in the United States last year (30). Histopathological and clinical criteria established by the World Health Organization are used to characterize these tumors into several subtypes (30). We considered the four main subtypes individually (Table S3).  Primary glioblastoma. These primary glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults, accounting for ∼17% of all intracranial tumors, and they confer the worst survival (median of ∼15 mo) (31). These high-grade (grade IV) tumors have no detectable precursor lesions and have been referred to as de novo tumors. The prevalence of TERT promoter mutations was remarkably high in GBMs of adults (83% of 78 tumors) (Table S3). This prevalence is higher than the prevalence of any other genetic mutation in this tumor type (32). These findings provide a molecular mechanism responsible for the high levels of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in GBMs (33).  For 51 of 78 primary GBM tumors, data on other common genetic alterations as well as clinical data were available (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, EGFR amplification, a classic molecular feature of primary GBM, exclusively occurred in tumors with TERT mutations (P = 0.0006, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Conversely, no association was identified between TERT mutation and either TP53 mutation or CDKN2A deletion. Importantly, the frequency of TERT promoter mutations was considerably less in primary GBMs of pediatric patients (11% of 19 tumors) than adult patients (Discussion) (Table S3). ALT was observed in 11% of 105 adult GBM and 44% of pediatric GBM (i.e., the reverse of the pattern observed for TERT promoter mutations) (13). Primary GBM patients without TERT mutations survived considerably longer, on average, than patients with such mutations (median = 27 vs. 14 mo, P = 0.01 by the log rank test) (Fig. S3).  Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Mutations of selected genes in glioma subtypes. (A) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events in 51 primary GBMs. (B) Distribution of TERT mutations and other genetic events among 40 astrocytomas, including grades II–III astrocytomas ... Astrocytomas. Infiltrative astrocytic tumors frequently progress, with recurrent lesions often of higher grade than the original lesions excised at surgery. They are most often grade II or III but can progress to grade IV (at which point they are often termed secondary GBMs). Astrocytomas of any stage rarely contained TERT promoter mutations (10% of 40 total samples) (Table S3). Instead, they more frequently contained isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations (75% of 40 tumors), ATRX mutations (70% of 40 tumors), and TP53 mutations (73% of 40 tumors) (Fig. 2B). ALT has been observed in 63% of 57 astrocytomas, consistent with the high prevalence of ATRX mutations (13). The lack of activating TERT mutations in IDH1 mutant tumors is also corroborated by the lack of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity observed in these lesions (33).  Oligodendrogliomas. Like astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas often progress, and they frequently contain TERT promoter mutations (78% of 45 tumor samples) (Table S3). Oligodendroglioma was the only tumor type studied (of all types, including non-CNS tumors) (Dataset S1) in which C250T mutations were nearly as frequent as C228T mutations. In oligodendrogliomas, 43% of tumors with TERT mutations contained C250T substitutions, whereas in other gliomas, only 10% did (P < 0.001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed). Interestingly, 91% of 45 oligodendrogliomas that were evaluated for ATRX and TERT sequence alterations contained either an ATRX coding or a TERT promoter mutation, suggesting that genetic alterations resulting in telomere maintenance are required for tumorigenesis of this subtype.  Oligodendrogliomas have long been known to contain characteristic losses of chromosome arms 1p and 19q, and these losses reflect inactivation of the CIC gene on chromosome 19q and in some cases, inactivation of the FUBP1 gene on chromosome 1p (34–36). Accordingly, 78% of 45 oligodendrogliomas contained chromosome arm 1p or 19q losses of heterozygosity (Fig. 2C) (34–36). Moreover, nearly all of them contained IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (93%).  Oligoastrocytomas. As their name implies, these tumors are mixed, with histologic features of both oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. This mixture, in part, reflects the difficulties in distinguishing the various glioma subtypes from one another on the basis of histopathologic or clinical criteria (37). The genetic features of this tumor subtype reflect this mixture: the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations (25% of 24 tumors) was intermediate between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, as were the frequencies of chromosome (Chr) 1p/19q losses and IDH1/2, TP53, and ATRX mutations (Fig. 2D).  ALT Vs. TERT. ALT has been observed in tumors of the CNS (particularly gliomas) more frequently than tumors of any other tissue type. Given that TERT promoter mutations are also common in gliomas, the relationship between these two features could be determined with high confidence. The tumors depicted in Fig. 2 had previously been evaluated for alterations in ATRX, which is a nearly perfect surrogate for the ALT phenotype (11, 37). Our data show that there were 50 gliomas with ATRX mutations and 83 gliomas with TERT mutations; 0 of 83 tumors with TERT mutations contained ATRX mutations (P < 0.0001, Fisher exact probability test, two-tailed).  Go to: DISCUSSION The results described above, as well as the results published in refs. 14 and 15, provide evidence that supports one of the hypotheses raised in the Introduction and refutes others. The first of these hypotheses was that TERT mutations would only be observed in tumors derived from tissues that are not constantly self-renewing under normal circumstances. This hypothesis was supported in part: the vast majority of TERT promoter mutations occurred in tumors derived from tissues that do not continually self-renew. The TERT-H tumor types include only melanomas, certain subtypes of glioma, medulloblastomas, squamous cell cancers of the tongue, liposarcomas, HCCs, and urinary tract cancers. The normal transitional cells of the urinary tract have very low proliferative indices (0.64% ± 0.52%), much lower than indices of gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, or skin (38). Normal hepatocytes also do not turnover often (39), and glial cells are thought to have limited capacity for self-renewal (40).  Two other observations also support the hypothesis. Pediatric primary GBMs rarely contained TERT mutations (11%), whereas adult primary GBMs frequently did (83%). Pediatric GBMs are presumably derived from cells that are still dividing at the time of tumor initiation, and therefore, there is no selective advantage conferred by activating telomerase through a genetic mutation. Adult GBMs, in contrast, are presumably derived from postmitotic cells, and they should require telomerase activation. Similarly, medulloblastomas are embryonal tumors that typically arise from precursor cells with high self-renewal rates that do not usually persist in adults. This finding is consistent with our observation that the mean age of medulloblastoma patients with TERT mutations was considerably older than the mean age of medulloblastoma patients without TERT mutations (Fig. S1A).  There are, however, exceptions that belie the hypothesis that TERT mutations occur only in non–self-renewing tissues. The epithelium that lines the tongue constantly self-renews, but many squamous carcinomas of the tongue harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). Additionally, the squamous epithelia of the tongue certainly would not be expected to self-renew less than other squamous epithelia of the oral cavity, but the latter rarely harbored TERT mutations (Table S2). This finding may suggest that squamous carcinomas of the tongue originate from a different cell of origin than other oral cavity squamous carcinomas. Conversely, only a subset of the tumor types derived from non–self-renewing tissues was TERT-H. For example, the TERT-H tumors included myxoid liposarcomas but not synovial sarcomas. Moreover, cells of the pancreas (the islets of Langerhans and the ductal epithelial cells) rarely renew, but pancreatic tumors of all types (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, acinar carcinomas, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas) were all TERT-L. The most that we can conclude at present is that non–self-renewing cell types are the major sources of TERT-H tumors but that non–self-renewal is only one of the factors that determines whether tumor cells with TERT promoter mutations will have a selective growth advantage over adjoining cells.  The first corollary to the hypothesis raised in the Introduction was that tumor types that displayed ALT would be those types that harbored TERT promoter mutations. This corollary is soundly refuted by these data, at least in general terms. Although tumor types of the CNS and liposarcomas had high frequencies of ALT as well as high frequencies of TERT promoter mutations, these tumor types were the exceptions rather than the rule. For example, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have very high frequencies of ALT but no evidence of TERT mutations. Conversely, bladder cancers frequently have TERT mutations but never have ALT (13). Additionally, even among gliomas, pediatric GBMs have high frequencies of ALT and low frequencies of TERT mutations, whereas adult GBMs have the reverse pattern.  The second corollary was that the selective advantage afforded by TERT mutation would be equivalent to the advantage afforded by ATRX mutation (conferring ALT). This hypothesis was most effectively tested in gliomas, in which both ATRX coding and TERT promoter mutations were common. There was a striking mutual exclusivity with respect to ATRX and TERT mutations (P < 0.0001), lending strong support to this idea.  These results also raise many unanswered questions. In some tumor types, such as gliomas, we can imagine that all tumors have genetically activated telomere maintenance programs through mutations in either TERT or ATRX. However, in other tumor types with frequent ATRX mutations, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, what is responsible for activating telomerase in the fraction of cases not exhibiting ALT if it is not a mutation in the TERT promoter? Similarly, what is responsible for activating telomerase in those tumors derived from non–self-renewing cell types in which neither ALT nor TERT mutations is frequently observed, such as synovial sarcomas or osteosarcomas? Also, there are occasional individual tumors among the TERT-L types that have TERT promoter mutations (e.g., cervical cancers, ovarian cancers, and in ref. 15, lung cancers). What distinguishes these occasional cancers from others of the same histopathologic subtype? Whole-genome sequencing studies, rather than those studies limited to the exome, might provide answers to these questions.  The results recorded here have practical as well as basic scientific implications. Two-thirds of bladder cancers had TERT promoter mutations, making it the most commonly mutated gene yet identified in invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Given the persistently high mortality rate despite multimodality treatment in this group of patients, these mutations represent ideal urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancers at an early stage and to follow patients for evidence of progression or recurrence once they have been diagnosed (41). Similarly, the high prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in HCCs and glioma subtypes provides excellent candidate biomarkers for early detection (HCC) or monitoring (HCC in the plasma and gliomas in the cerebrospinal fluid) (42, 43).  Another practical implication involves diagnostics. We conjecture that tumors with TERT promoter or ATRX mutations are derived from different precursor cells and that either type of precursor cell is different from those types that are the precursors of tumors without such mutations. This distinction could aid classification of the tumors in clinically meaningful ways. For example, Fig. 2 and Fig. S2 outline the major genetic alterations occurring in the three most common types of gliomas. On the basis of the data in Fig. 2 A–C, we speculate that oligodendrogliomas that lack TERT mutations but contain ATRX mutations may behave more like astrocytomas than oligodendrogliomas and vice versa. Similarly, the primary GBMs without TERT mutations (15% of the total) may behave more like advanced progressive astrocytomas, which generally lack TERT mutations. This possibility is supported by the observation that those primary GBM patients without TERT mutations had a longer survival, on average, than other primary GBM patients (Fig. S3).  Go to: METHODS All clinical information and tissue were obtained with consent and Institutional Review Board approval from the various institutions donating material to this study, and they were obtained in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Tissue sections were reviewed by board-certified pathologists to ensure that ≥50% of the cells used for DNA purification were neoplastic and confirm histopathological diagnosis. Oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-M13-GGCCGATTCGACCTCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGCACCTCGCGGTAGTGG-3′, where M13 is a universal sequencing priming site with sequence 5′-tgtaaaacgacggccagt-3′, were used to PCR-amplify the proximal TERT promoter containing C228 and C250 (chr5: 1,295,228; chr5: 1,295,250, respectively; hg19) for Sanger sequencing using standard methods (44). Primary GBM copy number data as well as ALT status were derived from the data published in refs. 37, 45, and 46, and OTX2 copy number expression was derived from the data published in ref. 27. Brain tumor patients were treated at the Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke. For the purposes of this study, secondary GBM designates a GBM that was resected >1 y after a prior diagnosis of a lower-grade glioma (grades I–III), and all other GBMs were considered to be primary GBMs. Pediatric GBM samples were defined as those samples occurring before 21 y of age.\""
